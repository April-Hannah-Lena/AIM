# 311. The sharp Belgian chocolate stabilization threshold

**Area:** Feedback control and polynomial stability

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-17

## Problem statement

Let $`\mathcal H`$ be the set of nonzero real polynomials whose roots all have strictly negative real part; nonzero constant polynomials belong to $`\mathcal H`$. Define

```math
\mathcal D=\left\{\delta\in(0,1):\quad
\begin{array}{l}
\text{there exist }x,y\in\mathcal H\text{ with }\deg y\le\deg x,\\[2pt]
(s^2-2\delta s+1)x(s)+(s^2-1)y(s)\in\mathcal H
\end{array}\right\}.
```

Determine the exact value of

```math
\delta_* = \sup\mathcal D.
```

The polynomial degrees are arbitrary finite integers, and coefficients are arbitrary real numbers. Stability is strict. The question asks for the sharp threshold over all degrees, with matching feasibility and impossibility arguments, rather than an optimum within a prescribed controller family. It is a supremum: the endpoint need not be attained by a pair of strictly stable polynomials.

## Application

For the plant $`G_\delta(s)=(s^2-1)/(s^2-2\delta s+1)`$, the quotient $`y/x`$ represents a proper, stable, minimum-phase linear time-invariant controller. The displayed combination is its closed-loop characteristic polynomial under negative feedback. The problem tests stabilization limits when an unstable pole approaches an unstable zero, a difficulty that also arises in engineering control design.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Charles–Boston report feasibility for every $`0<\delta\le0.9808348`$. Their finite-degree constructions and perturbations of polynomials with imaginary-axis roots do not identify the unrestricted threshold. Bergweiler–Eremenko prove $`\delta_*<0.999579`$, leaving a gap. Eremenko’s separate problem note asks for the corresponding extremal constant in the unit disk.

The solved $`\delta=0.9`$ prize instance is weaker than determining $`\delta_*`$. The switching and periodic-controller paper changes the time-invariance assumption and explicitly leaves the original problem unresolved. Likewise, exact results for other Goldberg constants impose different zero and one-point conditions.

September 17, 2026 searches covering recent and unrestricted resolution claims found no matching sharp-threshold result. The [evidence ledger](../research/expansion-2026-09/candidates/belgian-chocolate-threshold.json) records the source scopes, duplicate comparison and access limits. The polynomial, rational-control and equivalent holomorphic formulations are one problem family.

A clearly separated adversarial self-pass passed on September 17. Resolution searches and duplicate checks were refreshed immediately before the September 17, 2026 batch integration.
