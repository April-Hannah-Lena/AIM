# 649. Small mod-two area cycles in drawings with bounded pairwise intersections

**Area:** Topological graph theory and discrete geometry

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

Fix $k\ge2$. For $n\ge3$, consider drawings of $K_n$ entirely inside the unit square. Vertices are distinct points; edges are non-self-intersecting piecewise smooth arcs avoiding other vertices. Interior intersections are transverse crossings, and each pair of distinct edges has at most $k$ intersection points, counting a shared endpoint when present.

A nonzero $\mathbb F_2$-cycle is a nonempty subset of graph edges in which every vertex has even degree. It may be disconnected. For such a cycle $z$, define $A(z)$ as the area of the set of points having odd crossing parity with $z$ along a generic path to the unbounded component of its complement. This is the mod-two interior, so self-crossings do not require the cycle to bound a Jordan domain.

Does there exist a function $\varepsilon_k(n)\to0$ as $n\to\infty$ such that every such drawing contains a nonzero cycle $z$ with
$$A(z)\le\varepsilon_k(n)?$$

The bound must be uniform over drawings, while $k$ remains fixed.

## Application

This extends small-area phenomena in geometric point configurations to graph drawings whose edges may curve and cross repeatedly. It asks whether a uniform local intersection bound forces a global region of small parity area.

## Status review

**Known cases:** For simple drawings, corresponding to $k=1$, Zeng proves an $O(1/n)$ area bound for a non-self-intersecting four-cycle. Without a uniform bound on intersections, Hubard and Suk construct drawings in which every nonzero mod-two cycle has area bounded below by a positive constant.

**Remaining target:** Decide the vanishing-area statement for every fixed $k\ge2$. The later improvement for simple drawings does not allow an edge pair to intersect more than once. This question uses all nonzero mod-two cycles, not just triangles or Jordan cycles.
