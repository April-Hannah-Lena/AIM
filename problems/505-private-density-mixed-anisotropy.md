## Problem statement

Fix $`d\ge2`$, $`R^2>d`$, $`A>0`$, and vectors $`\boldsymbol\beta,\boldsymbol\delta\in\mathbb N_{>0}^d`$ such that $`\beta_m/\delta_m`$ is independent of $`m`$. Assume that some $`\delta_m<d`$ and some $`\delta_k>d`$.

Use the real Fourier basis $`\phi_1(t)=1`$, $`\phi_{2j}(t)=\sqrt2\cos(2\pi jt)`$ and $`\phi_{2j+1}(t)=\sqrt2\sin(2\pi jt)`$ for $`j\ge1`$, and its tensor products $`\phi_{\mathbf j}(x)=\prod_m\phi_{j_m}(x_m)`$. Write $`\theta_{\mathbf j}(h)=\int_{[0,1]^d}h\phi_{\mathbf j}`$ and define

```math
W^{\mathbf s}(r)=\left\{h\in L^2([0,1]^d):
\sum_{\mathbf j\in\mathbb N_{>0}^d}\left(\sum_{m=1}^d j_m^{2s_m}\right)|\theta_{\mathbf j}(h)|^2\le r^2\right\}.
```

Let $`\mathcal F_{\boldsymbol\beta,R}`$ be the probability densities in $`W^{\boldsymbol\beta}(R)`$, and set

```math
d_{\boldsymbol\delta}(h,f)=\sup_{g\in W^{\boldsymbol\delta}(1)}\left|\int_{[0,1]^d}(h-f)g\right|.
```

Given $`n`$ independent observations with density $`f`$, a sequentially interactive $`\alpha`$-locally private mechanism releases $`Z_i`$ through a channel $`Q_i(\cdot\mid X_i,Z_1,\ldots,Z_{i-1})`$ satisfying

```math
Q_i(B\mid x,z_{<i})\le e^\alpha Q_i(B\mid x',z_{<i})
```

for every measurable $`B`$, all $`x,x'`$ and all histories $`z_{<i}`$. Denote the class of these mechanisms by $`\mathcal Q_\alpha`$.

Determine, up to multiplicative constants independent of $`n`$ and $`\alpha`$, the minimax risk

```math
\mathcal R_{n,\alpha}(\boldsymbol\beta,\boldsymbol\delta)
=\inf_{Q\in\mathcal Q_\alpha}\inf_{\widehat f}
\sup_{f\in\mathcal F_{\boldsymbol\beta,R}}
\mathbb E_{f,Q}\,d_{\boldsymbol\delta}(\widehat f,f),
```

for $`0<\alpha\le A`$ and $`n\alpha^2\ge1`$. Estimators are measurable $`L^2`$-valued functions of the released data. The parameters $`d,R,\boldsymbol\beta,\boldsymbol\delta`$ are known and fixed. Matching lower and upper bounds must include any necessary logarithmic factors.

## Application

Different coordinates of a multivariate density can have different smoothness. Sharp rates would quantify the information lost when individuals privatize their observations before sharing them, under a loss that measures the accuracy of generated distributions through smooth test functions.

## Status review

Theorem 10 of [1] gives the lower bound

```math
\mathcal R_{n,\alpha}\gtrsim
\max\left\{(n\alpha^2)^{-(\bar\beta+\bar\delta)/(2\bar\beta+2d)},
(n\alpha^2)^{-1/2}\right\},\qquad
\bar\beta^{-1}=d^{-1}\sum_m\beta_m^{-1},\quad
\bar\delta^{-1}=d^{-1}\sum_m\delta_m^{-1}.
```

Theorem 11 supplies matching rates when every discriminator smoothness is below $`d`$, or every one is above $`d`$. Its separate all-equal-to-$`d`$ bound has a logarithmic gap. The paragraph after that theorem explicitly leaves minimax optimality open when the coordinates do not share a regime. The target here is the strict mixed case; the displayed lower bound is not asserted to be sharp there.
