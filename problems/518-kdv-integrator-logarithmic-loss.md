## Problem statement

Consider the real periodic KdV equation

```math
\partial_tu+\partial_x^3u=\tfrac12\partial_x(u^2),\qquad x\in\mathbb T=\mathbb R/(2\pi\mathbb Z),\qquad u(0)=u_0,
```

where $`u_0\in H^\gamma(\mathbb T)`$ has mean zero and $`0<\gamma\le1`$. Let $`S_t=e^{-t\partial_x^3}`$, let $`P_0f=(2\pi)^{-1}\int_{\mathbb T}f`$, and let $`P=I-P_0`$. The multiplier $`D^{-1}=\partial_x^{-1}`$ has symbol $`(ik)^{-1}`$ for $`k\ne0`$ and zero for $`k=0`$; set $`D^{-2}=(D^{-1})^2`$.

For $`\tau=T/L`$, define the Li–Wu time discretization by $`u^0=u_0`$ and

```math
u^{n+1}=S_\tau u^n+F_\tau(u^n)+H_\tau(u^n),
```

where

```math
F_\tau(f)=\tfrac16P[(S_\tau D^{-1}f)^2]-\tfrac16S_\tau P[(D^{-1}f)^2],
```

and

```math
\begin{aligned}
H_\tau(f)={}&\tfrac13P[(S_\tau D^{-1}f)D^{-1}F_\tau(f)]
+\tfrac\tau9(S_\tau D^{-1}f)P_0(f^2)\\
&-\tfrac1{54}\left[S_{\tau-s}D^{-1}[(S_sD^{-1}f)^3]\right]_{s=0}^{s=\tau}\\
&-\tfrac1{27\tau}\left[S_{\tau-s}D^{-2}[(S_{s-\tau}D^{-2}F_\tau(f))(S_sD^{-1}f)]\right]_{s=0}^{s=\tau}.
\end{aligned}
```

The brackets denote the value at $`s=\tau`$ minus the value at $`s=0`$. This is the time discretization in equation (1.4) of reference [1], without a spatial frequency cutoff.

For every $`T>0`$ and $`0<\gamma\le1`$, can the bound be sharpened to

```math
\max_{0\le n\le L}\|u(n\tau)-u^n\|_{L^2(\mathbb T)}\le C\tau^\gamma,
```

with $`C`$ and the admissible upper bound $`\tau_0>0`$ depending only on $`T`$, $`\gamma`$ and $`\|u_0\|_{H^\gamma}`$, for all $`\tau=T/L\le\tau_0`$? Prove this estimate or refute it for this particular scheme. No additional smoothness of $`u_0`$ is allowed.

## Application

KdV describes nonlinear dispersive waves, including long shallow-water waves. Rough measured or random initial data can reduce the accuracy of time-stepping methods. Removing the logarithmic loss would give a sharper relation between timestep and guaranteed error without requiring a frequency filter or smoother data.

## Status review

Reference [1] proves the displayed error bound with an additional factor $`\log(1/\tau)`$ and explicitly leaves its necessity unresolved. Reference [2] proves convergence for negative Sobolev regularity using a filtered scheme and an $`H^{-1/2}`$ error norm. Those results do not establish the proposed estimate for the scheme above.
