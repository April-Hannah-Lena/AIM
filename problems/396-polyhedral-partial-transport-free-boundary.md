# 396. Singular-set dimension of polyhedral partial-transport free boundaries

**Area:** Free-boundary PDEs / optimal transport

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Let $`n\ge3`$, and let bounded domains $`\Omega,\Omega^*\subset\mathbb R^n`$ be strictly separated by a hyperplane; assume $`\Omega^*`$ has boundary made of finitely many flat polygonal facets and may be nonconvex. Fix $`0<m<\min(|\Omega|,|\Omega^*|)`$. Minimize $`\int|x-y|^2\,d\gamma`$ over nonnegative measures of mass $`m`$ whose marginals are bounded by $`\mathbf1_\Omega dx`$ and $`\mathbf1_{\Omega^*}dy`$. Let $`U\subset\Omega`$ be the open active source region of the optimal plan and $`\mathcal F=\partial U\cap\Omega`$ its interior free boundary.
Must $`\mathcal F`$ be locally a smooth embedded hypersurface outside a relatively closed set of Hausdorff dimension at most $`n-2`$?

## Application

Partial transport selects which material to move when supply and demand need not be exhausted. Its free boundary separates moved from unmoved material and determines the stability of partial matching and resource allocation.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The 2026 source proves the two-dimensional polygonal result and explicitly leaves this higher-dimensional free-boundary conjecture. Searches through 22 September 2026 for partial transport nonconvex polytopes, Chen–Li–Liu Conjecture 5.2, and subsequent free-boundary regularity papers located no matching resolution. Smooth-target and convex-target results do not cover the stated nonconvex polyhedral geometry.
