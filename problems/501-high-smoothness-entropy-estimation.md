# 501. Minimax entropy estimation beyond two derivatives

**Area:** Nonparametric statistics and information estimation

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-23

## Problem statement

Fix $`d\ge3`$, $`s>2`$, $`2\le p<\infty`$ and a sufficiently large fixed radius $`L`$. Put $`r=\lceil s\rceil`$ and define

```math
\Delta_h^r f(x)=\sum_{j=0}^r(-1)^{r-j}\binom rj f\bigl(x+(j-r/2)h\bigr),\qquad
\omega_r(f,t)_p=\sup_{|h|\le t}\|\Delta_h^r f\|_{L^p(\mathbb R^d)}.
```

Let $`\mathcal F_{s,p,d}(L)`$ contain the probability densities supported on $`[0,1]^d`$ satisfying

```math
\|f\|_{L^p(\mathbb R^d)}+\sup_{t>0}t^{-s}\omega_r(f,t)_p\le L.
```

Here $`f`$ is extended by zero, so the norm also constrains its boundary behaviour. No positive lower bound on $`f`$ is imposed. Given $`n`$ independent observations with density $`f`$, estimate

```math
H(f)=-\int_{[0,1]^d}f(x)\log f(x)\,dx,\qquad 0\log0=0.
```

Determine, up to constants depending on $`s,p,d,L`$, the asymptotic order of

```math
R_n=\inf_{\widehat H}\sup_{f\in\mathcal F_{s,p,d}(L)}
\left(\mathbb E_f|\widehat H-H(f)|^2\right)^{1/2}.
```

The infimum is over measurable estimators based on the observations. In particular, is the known lower bound

```math
R_n\gtrsim(n\log n)^{-s/(s+d)}+n^{-1/2}
```

sharp throughout this high-smoothness regime? This is one rate-characterization problem, not separate entries for individual dimensions or exponents.

## Application

Differential-entropy estimation supports independence testing and independent component analysis. Sharp rates would quantify the sample cost of estimating this information measure for smooth densities that can approach zero; they would not by themselves establish optimal rates for every downstream test.

The efficiency theorem imposes additional integrability conditions involving local smoothness divided by the density.

## Status review

**Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.** The originating discussion identifies the high-smoothness obstruction. Bounds proved for $`0<s\le2`$, or for different classes controlling behaviour near zeros, do not settle the displayed general target. The lower bound alone does not justify a Partial label.

On 23 September 2026, searches covered high-smoothness differential entropy, Lipschitz classes, weighted nearest-neighbour estimators and later functional-estimation results, including indexed arXiv, Zenodo, GitHub and Palomar searches. No matching full-scope proof or announcement was located. Registry searches were not exhaustive exports.
