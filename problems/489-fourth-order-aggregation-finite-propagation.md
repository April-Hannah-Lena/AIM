# 489. Finite propagation in fourth-order aggregation–diffusion

**Area:** Degenerate parabolic PDEs; moving tissue boundaries

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Fix $d\ge2$ and $\chi>0$. For every compactly supported $\rho_0\in H^1(\mathbb R^d)$ with $\rho_0\ge0$ and $\int\rho_0=1$, does

$$
\partial_t\rho=-\nabla\cdot(\rho\nabla\Delta\rho)-\chi\Delta(\rho^2),\qquad \rho(0)=\rho_0,
$$

admit a nonnegative global weak solution with the following finite-propagation property: for every $T<\infty$, some $R_T<\infty$ satisfies $\rho(t,x)=0$ for almost every $(t,x)\in(0,T)\times(\mathbb R^d\setminus B_{R_T})$?

Here a weak solution is a narrowly continuous probability-valued curve with finite second moment and

$$
\rho\in L^\infty(0,T;H^1)\cap L^2(0,T;H^2)
$$

for every finite $T$, satisfying, for all $\phi\in C_c^2(\mathbb R^d)$ and $0\le a<b$,

$$
\int\phi[\rho(b)-\rho(a)]=-\int_a^b\!\int\bigl(\rho\Delta\rho\Delta\phi+\Delta\rho\nabla\rho\cdot\nabla\phi+\chi\rho^2\Delta\phi\bigr)\,dx\,dt.
$$

Narrow continuity means continuity against bounded continuous spatial tests. Only existence of a solution preserving bounded support on finite time intervals is requested; weak uniqueness is a separate question.

## Application

This would justify a genuine moving edge for compact tissue aggregates in a fourth-order local adhesion model.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The 2024 paper constructs weak solutions and explicitly identifies preservation of compact support as an unresolved free-boundary question, supported there by computations. The $m=2$ case above lies in its globally existing subcritical range in every finite dimension. Searches on 2026-09-22 for fourth-order aggregation–diffusion finite propagation and compact support found no later resolution for this model and class of initial data. Propagation results for other thin-film mobilities or for purely attractive second-order equations do not answer this statement.
