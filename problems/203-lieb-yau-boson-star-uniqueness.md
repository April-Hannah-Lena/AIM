# 203. Uniqueness of a boson star at every subcritical mass

**Area:** Relativistic quantum matter; self-gravitating waves

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

**Last checked:** 2026-09-13

## Problem statement

For $u\in H^{1/2}(\mathbb R^3)$ define

$$
D(u)=\iint\frac{|u(x)|^2|u(y)|^2}{|x-y|}\,dx\,dy,\qquad K(u)=\langle u,\sqrt{-\Delta}\,u\rangle,
$$



$$
N_* =\inf_{u\ne0}\frac{2K(u)\|u\|_2^2}{D(u)},\qquad \mathcal E(u)=\langle u,(\sqrt{-\Delta+1}-1)u\rangle-\tfrac12D(u).
$$

The square roots are Fourier multipliers. For every $0<N<N_*$, the infimum of $\mathcal E$ over $\|u\|_2^2=N$ is attained.

Is this minimizer unique modulo translation and constant phase for every such $N$? Precisely, must any two minimizers satisfy $v(x)=e^{i\theta}u(x-x_0)$ for some $\theta\in\mathbb R$, $x_0\in\mathbb R^3$?

## Application

The model balances relativistic kinetic energy and Newtonian attraction. Uniqueness would determine whether a fixed subcritical stellar mass selects a single equilibrium density profile.

Section 1, equations (1.1)–(1.3) and the paragraph before (1.4), explicitly retain the full conjecture; Theorem 1.1 concerns the nonrelativistic regime.

## Status review

**Known cases:** Uniqueness modulo translation and phase is established for sufficiently small positive mass.

**Remaining target:** Uniqueness for every mass in the full subcritical interval.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The August 2026 paper expressly leaves the entire interval $0<N<N_*$ open. Its new proof, like the earlier result of Guo and Zeng, establishes uniqueness only for sufficiently small mass. Fixing the rest mass at one is a choice of units.

**Search audit:** Queries: “Lieb Yau boson star uniqueness 2025 2026”, “pseudo relativistic Hartree uniqueness full mass conjecture”; checked the August 2026 theorem against the full interval. Searches included later proofs, counterexamples, and 2025–2026 updates. No resolution matching the stated hypotheses was located.
