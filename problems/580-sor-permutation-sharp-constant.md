# 580. Sharp permutation bound for triangular parts of correlation matrices

**Area:** Numerical linear algebra and iterative methods

## Problem statement

For an integer $`n\ge1`$, let $`B\in\mathbb C^{n\times n}`$ be Hermitian positive semidefinite with $`B_{ii}=1`$ for every $`i`$. For a permutation $`\sigma`$ of $`\{1,\ldots,n\}`$, let $`P_\sigma`$ be its permutation matrix and let $`L_\sigma`$ denote the strictly lower triangular part of $`P_\sigma BP_\sigma^*`$.

Prove or disprove Oswald's conjecture that every such $`B`$ admits a permutation satisfying

```math
\|L_\sigma\|_2\le\frac{2}{\pi}\|B\|_2,
```

where $`\|\cdot\|_2`$ is the spectral norm.

Equivalently, determine whether

```math
\sup_{n\ge1}\ \sup_{\substack{B=B^*\succeq0\\B_{ii}=1}}\ \min_\sigma\frac{\|L_\sigma\|_2}{\|B\|_2}=\frac2\pi.
```

The proposed constant is uniform in dimension. The all-ones matrices show that no smaller universal constant can work: permutations leave them unchanged and their strictly lower triangular parts have norm asymptotic to $`2n/\pi`$, while the full matrices have norm $`n`$.

## Application

The norm of the triangular part enters convergence bounds for successive over-relaxation after reordering the equations. A sharp estimate would quantify how much a suitable single permutation can improve these bounds independently of the system size.

## Status review

The correction proves a dimension-independent bound with constant $`122.3`$ for positive semidefinite matrices. It withdraws the earlier claimed constant $`32.42`$ and explicitly proposes $`2/\pi`$ for the unit-diagonal class. Its estimates for the expectation of a squared triangular-part matrix do not imply the sharp bound for an individual permutation.
