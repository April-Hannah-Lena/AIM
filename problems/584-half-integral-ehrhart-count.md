# 584. Counting Ehrhart quasipolynomials of half-integral polygons

**Area:** Discrete geometry and Ehrhart theory

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

For a two-dimensional convex polygon $P$ with vertices in $\tfrac12\mathbb Z^2$, define its Ehrhart quasipolynomial by

$$
L_P(t)=|tP\cap\mathbb Z^2|\qquad(t\in\mathbb Z_{\ge0}).
$$

Its coefficient functions have period dividing two; integral polygons and polygons with period collapse are included.

For an integer $i\ge2$, let $E(i)$ be the number of distinct functions $L_P$ arising from such polygons with exactly $i$ interior lattice points and at least two boundary lattice points. Prove or disprove that

$$
E(i)=\frac92 i^3+36i^2+\frac{175}{2}i+53\qquad(i\ge2).
$$

Different polygons with the same lattice-point counting function contribute only once. There is no collinearity assumption on the interior points.

## Application

Ehrhart quasipolynomials describe lattice-point counts under dilation, a central operation in integer optimization and polyhedral geometry. An exact count would characterize the diversity of possible counting functions in the first nonintegral denominator class.

## Status review

The March 2026 version of record [1] states this conjecture with at least two boundary lattice points and reports computational verification through $i=16$. This published statement is the one used here. The earlier related preprint [3] prints a different boundary threshold in its conjecture; it is not being substituted for the published formulation.

Sharp area and coefficient bounds in [3], and classifications for period-collapse polygons, do not provide the full enumeration. The dataset [2] and its companion code supply finite computations. Current searches found no matching solution announcement or repository duplicate.
