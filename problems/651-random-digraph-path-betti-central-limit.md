# 651. Central limit theorem for the first path Betti number

**Area:** Applied topology / probability
**Status:** 🔵 OPEN
**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

Let $`G_n`$ be a random digraph on $`[n]`$, with every ordered edge $`(i,j)`$, $`i\ne j`$, present independently with probability $`p_n`$. Reciprocal edges are allowed. Assume

```math
np_n\longrightarrow\infty,\qquad n^{2/3}p_n\longrightarrow0.
```

Define the non-regular first path Betti number as follows. Over $`\mathbb Q`$, let $`\Lambda_k`$ be spanned by all vertex sequences $`[v_0,\ldots,v_k]`$, with the alternating deletion boundary $`\partial`$. Let $`A_k`$ be the span of sequences whose successive edges belong to $`G_n`$, and, for $`k\ge1`$, put

```math
\Omega_k=A_k\cap\partial^{-1}(A_{k-1}),\qquad
B_n=\dim_{\mathbb Q}\frac{\ker(\partial:\Omega_1\to\Omega_0)}{\partial\Omega_2}.
```

Repeated vertices are permitted, and no terms with consecutive repetitions are discarded by the boundary. Here $`\Omega_0=A_0`$. This is the rank of the source's integer non-regular path homology.

Does every sequence $`(p_n)`$ satisfying the two conditions obey

```math
\frac{B_n-\mathbb E B_n}{\sqrt{\mathop{\mathrm{Var}}\nolimits(B_n)}}
\xrightarrow{\ d\ }\mathcal N(0,1)?
```

## Application

A central limit theorem would support calibrated significance tests for path-homology features in directed networks without repeatedly computing homology for large collections of simulated graphs.

## Status review

Conjecture B.2 explicitly proposes this limit in the stated density range. The source proves $`\mathbb E B_n\sim n(n-1)p_n`$ and concentration relative to this mean, but those results do not give a limit for fluctuations at the standard-deviation scale. Its numerical normality tests are evidence, not a proof. Current searches found no matching solution or announced proof.
