## Problem statement

Fix integers $q\ge2$, $m\ge2q$ and a real $\delta>-m$ such that

$$
x=\frac{m+\delta}{2m+\delta}<\frac1{2q}.
$$

Start with two vertices joined by $m$ parallel edges. At each time $t\ge3$, add vertex $t$ and $m$ edges, sequentially. Given the graph after the first $a-1$ new edges, choose the old endpoint $v<t$ of edge $a$ with probability

$$
\frac{d_{t,a-1}(v)+\delta}{2m(t-2)+(a-1)+(t-1)\delta},\qquad 1\le a\le m,
$$

where $d_{t,a-1}(v)$ is its current degree, counting multiplicity. There are no self-loops. Let $X_T$ be the clique complex of the underlying simple graph at time $T$, and set $\beta_q(T)=\dim_{\mathbb Q}H_q(X_T;\mathbb Q)$.

Does

$$
\frac{\beta_q(T)}{\mathbb E\beta_q(T)}\ \xrightarrow[T\to\infty]{\mathrm d}\ W_{q,m,\delta}
$$

hold for a nondegenerate random variable? Determine the limiting law, or disprove this assertion. In particular, establish or refute the proposed power-law tail and, where it holds, determine its exponent. One precise tail formulation to test is regular variation:

$$
\lim_{z\to\infty}\frac{\Pr(W_{q,m,\delta}>uz)}{\Pr(W_{q,m,\delta}>z)}=u^{-\alpha(q,m,\delta)},\qquad u>0,
$$

for some positive $\alpha(q,m,\delta)$.

This formulates the distributional question in [1] within the strict polynomial-growth regime. The expectation is over graph generation, rather than an empirical average across simulated networks. Regular variation is a precise version of the paper's numerical power-law suggestion, not an already established property.

## Application

Limit distributions would calibrate the variability of higher-order connectivity statistics in growing networks with hubs. They would support uncertainty assessments when observed topological features are compared with a preferential-attachment null model.

## Status review

The expectation has order $T^{1-2qx}$ in this regime [2]. Theorem 4.1 of [1] bounds the random Betti number between $T^{1-2qx}/\omega(T)$ and $\omega(T)T^{1-2qx}$ with probability tending to one, for every $\omega(T)\to\infty$. These order estimates do not identify a distributional limit. The simulated tail exponents in [1] are evidence, not proofs.
