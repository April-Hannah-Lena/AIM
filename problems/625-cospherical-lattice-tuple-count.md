# 625. Counting cospherical tuples in lattice cubes

**Area:** Discrete geometry and lattice-point counting

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

For fixed $d\ge3$ and $n\ge1$, let $S(n,d)$ count ordered tuples of $d+2$ pairwise distinct points of $\{1,\ldots,n\}^d$ that lie on some Euclidean sphere

$$
\{x\in\mathbb R^d:\|x-a\|_2=R\},\qquad a\in\mathbb R^d,\quad R>0.
$$

Count a tuple once even if several spheres contain it. Hyperplanes are not counted as spheres.

Is there a constant $C_d$, independent of $n$, such that

$$
S(n,d)\le C_d n^{d^2+d-1}
$$

for all $n$?

## Application

Bounding degeneracies in integer grids controls random constructions of large point sets in spherical general position and the incidence structure of lifted point configurations.

## Status review

The source proves the two-dimensional case and leaves higher dimensions open. Its hypergraph formulation and tuple-selection arguments use distinct points; allowing repetitions would introduce a larger trivial contribution. Dong and Xu's large sphere-avoiding grid subsets settle the related existence lower bound, not this count over all tuples.
