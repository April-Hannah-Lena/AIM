# 195. A continuous strictly decreasing moment spectrum for Gaussian polymers

**Area:** Polymers in random media

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-08

## Problem statement

Let $`(S_n)`$ be simple random walk on $`\mathbb Z^3`$ from zero and let $`\omega_{n,x}`$ be iid standard Gaussians independent of the walk. For $`\beta>0`$, set

```math
W_N^\beta=E_S\exp\!\left(\sum_{n=1}^N(\beta\omega_{n,S_n}-\beta^2/2)\right),\qquad
p^*(\beta)=\sup\{p\ge1:\sup_N\mathbb E_\omega[(W_N^\beta)^p]<\infty\}.
```

Write $`W_\infty^\beta`$ for the nonnegative martingale limit and define $`\beta_c=\sup\{\beta:P(W_\infty^\beta>0)=1\}`$. Is $`\beta\mapsto p^*(\beta)`$ a continuous strictly decreasing bijection from $`(0,\beta_c]`$ onto $`[5/3,\infty)`$? Continuity at $`\beta_c`$ means continuity from the left.

## Application

In this random polymer model, partition-function moments describe fluctuations across environments. The conjecture would describe how the threshold for uniformly bounded moments changes with disorder. It does not by itself identify the exact disorder threshold for bounded variance or settle boundedness at the moment threshold.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The 2026 notes explicitly conjecture the full moment-spectrum statement. Results excluding constant intervals under a finite-support disorder assumption do not apply to Gaussian disorder. Fixing dimension three and the Gaussian law avoids treating different parameter instances as separate entries.
