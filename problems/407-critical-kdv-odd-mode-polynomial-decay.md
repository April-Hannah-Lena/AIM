# 407. Polynomial decay for KdV with three critical linear modes

**Area:** Dispersive PDEs / boundary stabilization

**Status:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Set $L=14\pi$. For the real-valued KdV problem
$$y_t+y_x+y_{xxx}+yy_x=0,\quad 0<x<L,\qquad y(t,0)=y(t,L)=y_x(t,L)=0,$$
do there exist $\delta,C,\alpha>0$ such that every solution with $\|y(0)\|_{L^2(0,L)}\le\delta$ satisfies
$$\|y(t)\|_{L^2(0,L)}\le C(1+t)^{-\alpha}\qquad(t\ge0)?$$
Solutions are taken in the usual energy class $C([0,\infty);L^2)\cap L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}([0,\infty);H^1_0)$. This length has three undamped linear modes: the integer pairs $(7,7),(2,11),(11,2)$ satisfy $L=2\pi\sqrt{(k^2+k\ell+\ell^2)/3}$.

## Applied significance

KdV models long shallow-water waves. At critical channel lengths the boundary fails to damp some linear modes, so nonlinear energy transfer determines whether a quantitative algebraic stabilization rate exists.

## Status review

The December 2025 paper expressly identifies polynomial decay for odd undamped dimension greater than one as open. The length 14π is a concrete instance with dimension three. Its completed classification of small-time controllability does not establish uncontrolled polynomial decay. Searches through 22 September 2026 for this length, odd critical modes and later decay results located no resolution.
