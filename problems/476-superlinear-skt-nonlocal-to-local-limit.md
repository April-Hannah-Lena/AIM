## Problem statement

Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$ be smooth, bounded and connected, $n\ge2$, and $s>1$. Set
$$P_i(u)=u_i(a_{i0}+\sum_j a_{ij}u_j^s),\qquad
f_i(u)=b_{i0}-\sum_jb_{ij}u_j,$$
where $a_{i0}>0$, $b_{i0},b_{ij}\ge0$, and the symmetric matrix $(a_{ij})$ has nonnegative entries and satisfies
$$a_{ii}>C(s)\sum_{j\ne i}a_{ij},\quad
C(s)=\begin{cases}s^2/[2(s+1)(s-1)],&1<s<2,\\{[4(s-1)^2+1]}/[4(s+1)(s-1)],&s\ge2.\end{cases}$$
Choose a smooth nonnegative radial compactly supported kernel $J$, positive near zero, normalized by $\tfrac12\int_{\mathbb R^d}J(z)z_1^2\,dz=1$, and $J_\varepsilon(z)=\varepsilon^{-d}J(z/\varepsilon)$. Let $u^\varepsilon$ be the global nonnegative strong solution of
$$\partial_tu_i^\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{-2}\int_\Omega J_\varepsilon(x-y)[P_i(u^\varepsilon(y))-P_i(u^\varepsilon(x))]dy+u_i^\varepsilon f_i(u^\varepsilon)$$
with fixed nonnegative $u_i^0\in L^\infty(\Omega)\cap BV(\Omega)$.

As $\varepsilon\downarrow0$, does a subsequence converge strongly in $L^1((0,T)\times\Omega)^n$ for every finite $T$ to a global weak solution of
$$\partial_tu_i=\Delta P_i(u)+u_if_i(u),\qquad\partial_\nu P_i(u)=0,\qquad u_i(0)=u_i^0?$$
The limiting fluxes and reactions must pass to the limit in the weak formulation, not just the densities.

## Application

The limit would justify replacing finite-range population dispersal by a local SKT cross-diffusion law when the interaction range is small.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The September 2026 source explicitly calls extension of the localization argument to $s\ne1$ open. Its global nonlocal theorem uses the stronger coefficient condition written here; merely copying the weaker condition for the local equation would not justify the approximating solutions. Searches on 2026-09-22 for superlinear SKT localization and the paper title found no subsequent resolution. Local limits for convolution inside the pressure or triangular diffusion matrices are different models or restrictions.
