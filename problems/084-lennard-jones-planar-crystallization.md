# 084. The bulk ground-state energy of the planar Lennard–Jones system

**Area:** Atomistic materials

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-08

## Problem statement

For distinct points $`x_1,\ldots,x_N\in\mathbb R^2`$, define

```math
E_N(x_1,\ldots,x_N)=\sum_{1\le i<j\le N}
\left(|x_i-x_j|^{-12}-2|x_i-x_j|^{-6}\right),\qquad
e_\infty=\liminf_{N\to\infty}\frac1N\inf E_N.
```

Let $`\Lambda_\triangle=\mathbb Z(1,0)+\mathbb Z(1/2,\sqrt3/2)`$ and

```math
e_\triangle=\inf_{a>0}\frac12\sum_{p\in\Lambda_\triangle\setminus\{0\}}
\left(|ap|^{-12}-2|ap|^{-6}\right).
```

Prove or disprove $`e_\infty=e_\triangle`$. The finite configurations are unrestricted; they are not assumed to be lattices. This asks for the energy form of bulk crystallization, not the stronger geometric convergence of every minimizing configuration.

## Application

The equality would derive the energetic preference for a triangular crystal directly from a widely used atomic pair potential.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

These sources separate unrestricted Lennard–Jones crystallization from results for modified potentials and restricted lattice classes. The status search found recent exact Lennard–Jones lattice optimization work; optimizing over lattices alone does not provide the lower bound over all N-point configurations above.

Status-search topics (2026-09-08): `Lennard-Jones crystallization open problem mathematics`; `crystallization Lennard-Jones 2025 open`; `On minima of differences of Epstein zeta functions and exact solutions to Lennard–Jones lattice energy`. This is a literature search, not a proof that no solution exists.
