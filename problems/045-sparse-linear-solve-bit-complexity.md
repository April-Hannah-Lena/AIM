# 045. Quadratic-scale bit complexity for well-conditioned sparse systems

**Area:** Sparse numerical linear algebra

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-08

## Problem statement

For each fixed positive integer $`c`$, let $`A\in\mathbb Q^{n\times n}`$ be nonsingular with $`m=\mathop{\mathrm{nnz}}\nolimits(A)`$ and $`\kappa_2(A)=\|A\|_2\|A^{-1}\|_2\le n^c`$, and let $`b\in\mathbb Q^n\setminus\{0\}`$. Assume all numerators and denominators in the input have at most $`c\lceil\log_2(2n)\rceil`$ bits.

Is there a randomized algorithm using $`\widetilde O(nm)`$ bit operations which, with probability at least $`0.99`$, outputs a rational $`\widehat x`$ satisfying

```math
\|\widehat x-A^{-1}b\|_2\le n^{-c}\|A^{-1}b\|_2?
```

Here $`\widetilde O`$ hides powers of $`\log n`$, with constants allowed to depend on fixed $`c`$. The input is given by its sparse nonzero list. The target is a finite-precision complexity bound, including all arithmetic costs.

## Application

For matrices with O(n) nonzeros, this asks for approximately quadratic bit work even when no graph or positive-definite structure is available. It targets the cost of reliable sparse solves in general scientific models.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located

Checked on **2026-09-08**. Problem 2.10 asks whether the O(n nnz(A)) arithmetic scale extends to finite precision. This entry fixes polynomial conditioning and input precision explicitly. No later bound meeting the target was located.
