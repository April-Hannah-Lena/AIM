# 214. Optimal spectral signings of regular graphs

**Area:** Spectral graph theory / network design

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

**Last checked:** 2026-09-13

## Problem statement

For an integer $`d\ge2`$, let $`G=(V,E)`$ be any finite simple undirected $`d`$-regular graph. A signing is a map $`s:E\to\{-1,1\}`$. Its signed adjacency matrix is the real symmetric matrix

```math
(A_s)_{uv}=\begin{cases}s(\{u,v\}),&\{u,v\}\in E,\\0,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}
```

Does every such graph admit a signing for which every eigenvalue $`\lambda`$ of $`A_s`$ satisfies

```math
|\lambda|\le2\sqrt{d-1}?
```

Both ends of the spectrum must satisfy the bound.

## Application

A signing defines a two-sheeted graph lift: positive edges stay in the same sheet and negative edges cross sheets. This conjecture would let network designers double a regular network while controlling all newly introduced spectral modes at the optimal universal-cover threshold.

## Status review

**Known cases:** The optimal two-sided spectral signing bound is established for bipartite regular graphs.

**Remaining target:** The same optimal two-sided bound for every finite simple regular graph.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The bipartite case is known, because a one-sided signing bound then controls both spectral ends. The June 2026 general result gives $`2\sqrt{3(d-1)}`$, which leaves the requested constant unresolved. The July preprint imposes structural hypotheses and allows an error factor; its companion result on specific circulants does not cover all regular graphs.

**Search audit:** Searched “Bilu Linial conjecture solved proof signing 2026”, “two-sided Ramanujan signings”, and June–September 2026 follow-ups, including arXiv:2607.17343 and arXiv:2607.18334. Searches included later proofs, counterexamples, and 2025–2026 updates. No resolution matching the stated hypotheses was located.
