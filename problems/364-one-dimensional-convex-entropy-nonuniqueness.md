# 364. Can one-dimensional entropy-dissipating systems have two bounded solutions?

**Area:** Continuum mechanics; admissibility of shock dynamics

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Do there exist an integer $N\ge2$, an open convex state set $U\subset\mathbb R^N$, a smooth flux $f:U\to\mathbb R^N$ with $Df(u)$ having $N$ distinct real eigenvalues for every $u\in U$, and a smooth entropy pair $(\eta,q)$ satisfying
$$D^2\eta(u)>0,\qquad Dq(u)=D\eta(u)Df(u),$$
together with $T>0$ and bounded measurable initial data $u_0$, for which two distinct bounded distributional solutions $u,v:(0,T)\times\mathbb R\to K\Subset U$ satisfy
$$w_t+f(w)_x=0,\qquad \partial_t\eta(w)+\partial_xq(w)\le0\quad(w=u,v),$$
and both attain $u_0$ strongly in $L^1_{\rm loc}$ at $t=0$? Distinct means that they differ on a set of positive spacetime measure. The displayed entropy inequality must hold throughout spacetime, rather than only at jump discontinuities; no bounded-variation hypothesis is imposed.

## Application

An entropy inequality encodes the second law or energy dissipation in continuum models. This problem tests whether that physical criterion by itself can fail to select a unique one-dimensional evolution when arbitrarily fine oscillations are allowed.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Checked on 22 September 2026 using one-dimensional nonuniqueness with strictly convex entropy, $p$-system convex integration, and Bressan's Open Problem 6. Krupa's 2026 paper obtains nonuniqueness satisfying jump-based Liu admissibility, but explicitly states that its construction does not satisfy the required convex entropy condition. Multidimensional compressible Euler counterexamples use additional spatial dimensions. The small-BV uniqueness theorem does not apply to arbitrary bounded solutions. No matching one-dimensional entropy-admissible example was located.
