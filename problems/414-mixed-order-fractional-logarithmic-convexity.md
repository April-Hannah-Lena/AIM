# 414. Logarithmic convexity for two coupled subdiffusion orders

**Area:** Fractional PDE systems / inverse problems

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a bounded smooth domain and fix $0<\alpha_1<\alpha_2<1$ and $T>0$. For homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions consider
$$\partial_t^{\alpha_1}u_1=\Delta u_1+u_1+u_2,\qquad \partial_t^{\alpha_2}u_2=\Delta u_2+u_1+u_2,$$
with initial pair $U_0\in L^2(\Omega)^2$. Each derivative is Caputo: $\partial_t^\alpha h=\Gamma(1-\alpha)^{-1}\int_0^t(t-s)^{-\alpha}h'(s)\,ds$. Writing $U=(u_1,u_2)$ and using the product $L^2$ norm, is there a constant $C=C(\Omega,\alpha_1,\alpha_2,T)$ independent of $U_0$ such that
$$\|U(t)\|\le C\|U_0\|^{1-t/T}\|U(T)\|^{t/T}\qquad(0<t<T)$$
for every mild solution?

## Application

Coupled materials or chemical species can have different memory exponents. An interpolation estimate would support stable inverse recovery for such multi-component anomalous diffusion systems.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The recent source poses this exact coupled system. Its two distinct time orders prevent reduction to the single-order self-adjoint theorem. Searches through 22 September 2026 for mixed-order coupled diffusion, logarithmic convexity and backward recovery found no matching resolution. This concerns coupling of distinct memory laws, separate from nonsymmetric spatial drift.
