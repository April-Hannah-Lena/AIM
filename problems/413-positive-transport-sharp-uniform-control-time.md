# 413. Sharp vanishing-viscosity control time for downstream transport

**Area:** PDE control / advection–diffusion

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Fix $`L,M>0`$. For $`\varepsilon>0`$, consider

```math
y_t+My_x-\varepsilon y_{xx}=0\quad\text{in }(0,T)\times(0,L),\qquad y(t,0)=h(t),\quad y(t,L)=0,
```

with $`y(0)=y_0\in L^2(0,L)`$, interpreted by transposition for boundary inputs $`h\in L^2(0,T)`$. Define

```math
C(T,\varepsilon)=\sup_{\|y_0\|_2\le1}\inf\{\|h\|_{L^2(0,T)}:y(T)=0\}.
```

Is it true that for every $`T>L/M`$,

```math
\lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow0}C(T,\varepsilon)=0?
```

The actuator is at the inflow endpoint and $`M`$ is strictly positive.

## Application

Advection carries a contaminant or temperature perturbation out of a channel in time L/M. The problem asks whether arbitrarily small diffusion changes that sharp control horizon or requires nonvanishing actuation after the flushing time.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The negative-velocity part of the original Coron–Guerrero conjecture has been disproved and is deliberately absent from this formulation. The 2023 treatment still records a gap between the positive-velocity lower and upper times. Searches through 22 September 2026 found no matching resolution for T>L/M; Lissy’s August 2026 arXiv:2608.08041 establishes a heat-control cost coefficient, not the displayed transport limit.
