# 409. Polynomial anisotropic minimal graphs in dimensions four and five

**Area:** Quasilinear elliptic PDEs / crystalline surface energy

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Does there exist $`n\in\{4,5\}`$, a non-affine real polynomial $`u`$ on $`\mathbb R^n`$, and a positive even integrand $`\Phi\in C^{2,1}(S^n)`$ whose positively one-homogeneous extension to $`\mathbb R^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}`$ has uniformly convex level sets, such that

```math
\mathop{\mathrm{div}}\nolimits\big(D F(\nabla u)\big)=0\quad\text{on }\mathbb R^n,\qquad F(p)=\Phi((-p,1))?
```

Here uniform convexity means that $`D^2\Phi(\nu)`$ restricted to $`\nu^\perp`$ is positive definite with a positive lower bound uniform over $`\nu\in S^n`$.

## Application

Anisotropic surface energies describe orientation-dependent interface tension in crystals. A polynomial equilibrium would provide an exact nonplanar model in the lowest dimensions where Bernstein rigidity can fail.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The six-dimensional polynomial construction uses a C2,1 integrand, so that regularity is fixed explicitly here. The four-dimensional Bernstein counterexamples have subquadratic growth and do not supply a polynomial. September 2026 arXiv:2609.08972 proves a lower growth gap; August 2026 arXiv:2608.29117 concerns integrands close to isotropic area. Neither settles polynomial existence for arbitrary uniformly elliptic integrands in dimensions four or five. No matching resolution was located through 22 September 2026.
