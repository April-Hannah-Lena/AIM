# 461. Uniqueness of positive harmonic profiles for singular stable operators in cones

**Area:** Nonlocal elliptic PDEs; free-boundary blow-up profiles

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Let $`n\ge2`$, $`0<s<1`$, and let $`\mu`$ be a finite even nonnegative measure on $`S^{n-1}`$ such that

```math
\mu(S^{n-1})\le\Lambda,\qquad\inf_{|e|=1}\int_{S^{n-1}}|e\cdot\theta|^{2s}\,\mu(d\theta)\ge\lambda>0.
```

Define the stable operator

```math
Lu(x)=\frac12\int_{S^{n-1}}\int_0^\infty[2u(x)-u(x+r\theta)-u(x-r\theta)]\frac{dr}{r^{1+2s}}\,\mu(d\theta).
```

Let $`\Sigma\subsetneq\mathbb R^n`$ be a closed convex cone with nonempty interior. Suppose $`w_1,w_2`$ are continuous on $`\mathbb R^n`$, zero on $`\Sigma`$, strictly positive on $`\Sigma^c`$, and satisfy $`Lw_i=0`$ in $`\Sigma^c`$ in the viscosity sense. Assume $`|w_i(x)|\le C_i(1+|x|)^{\beta_i}`$ for some $`\beta_i<2s`$, so the tails in the equation are integrable. Must $`w_1=cw_2`$ for a constant $`c>0`$? Allow $`\mu`$ to be singular, including measures supported on finitely many directions.

## Application

Uniqueness of these profiles is an ingredient in classifying contact interfaces for obstacle problems driven by anisotropic jumps.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

This is the integrable-growth version of Open Question 4.4. The published 2026 paper obtains results under an $`L^p`$ angular-density hypothesis with $`p>n/(2s)`$ and explicitly identifies the general stable class as unresolved. Its preprint dates from 2023; publication in 2026 is not a new resolution for singular spectral measures. Searches on 2026-09-22 for positive cone profiles and singular stable boundary Harnack principles found no general uniqueness result. Interior Harnack inequalities themselves may fail in this class.
