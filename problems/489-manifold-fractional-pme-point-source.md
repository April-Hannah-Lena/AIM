# 489. Point-source solutions of fractional porous-medium diffusion on manifolds

**Area:** Nonlocal PDEs; anomalous diffusion from a point source

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Let $(M,g)$ be a complete, connected, noncompact Riemannian manifold of dimension $N\ge2$, with $\mathrm{Ric}\ge-(N-1)k$ for some $k\ge0$ and the uniform Faber–Krahn inequality
$\lambda_1(D)\ge c\,\mathrm{Vol}(D)^{-2/N}$ for all relatively compact smooth domains $D\subset M$, with $c>0$. Fix $m>1$ and $0<s<1$ and use the spectral fractional Laplace–Beltrami operator in
$$\partial_tu+(-\Delta_M)^s(u^m)=0.$$

For every $o\in M$ and $A>0$, does there exist a nonnegative distributional solution $u$ for $t>0$ with
$$u\in C((0,\infty);L^1(M))\cap L^\infty_{\rm loc}((0,\infty)\times M),\qquad
0<\sup_{0<t<T}\|u(t)\|_1\le A\quad(T>0),$$
whose initial trace is $A\delta_o$? Precisely, require $u^m\in L^1_{\rm loc}((0,\infty)\times M)$, the identity
$$\int_0^\infty\!\int_M u\,\partial_t\phi=\int_0^\infty\!\int_Mu^m(-\Delta_M)^s\phi$$
for compactly supported smooth tests (with integrable right side), and
$\lim_{t\downarrow0}\int_Mu(t)\psi=A\psi(o)$ for every bounded continuous $\psi$. No radial symmetry or homogeneity of $M$ is assumed.

## Application

A fundamental solution represents release of a concentrated amount of material and supplies a candidate reference profile for the spread of general concentrations.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Both §7 of the 2024 paper and the 2025 Oberwolfach report explicitly leave existence for Dirac initial data open on this manifold class. Searches on 2026-09-22 checked fundamental solutions, measure data and later manifold diffusion publications. Known measure-data results for Euclidean fractional diffusion and nonfractional negatively curved diffusion do not cover this combination of geometry and operator. Only existence is requested; no unsupported universal asymptotic profile on arbitrary manifolds is asserted.
