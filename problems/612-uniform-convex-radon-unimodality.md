# 612. Unimodality of Radon partitions for uniform convex samples

**Area:** Stochastic geometry and convexity

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

Let $d\ge2$, let $K\subset\mathbb R^d$ be a compact convex body with nonempty interior, and set $n=d+2$. Draw $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ independently from normalized Lebesgue measure on $K$. Almost surely their Radon partition is unique: it divides the sample into two nonempty sets $A,B$ with intersecting convex hulls.

Choose $A$ or $B$ with equal probability, independently of the sample, and let $p_k$ be the probability that the chosen set contains $k$ points. Prove or disprove that
$$p_1\le p_2\le\cdots\le p_{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}.$$
Since $p_k=p_{n-k}$, this is unimodality of the whole size distribution.

## Application

The question extends classical random-convex-position problems to higher-dimensional samples. It asks whether balanced affine dependencies are more frequent for uniform data in every convex sampling region.

## Status review

The source proves even ultra log-concavity for Gaussian samples, but explicitly leaves unimodality for uniform convex-body samples open. Its counterexamples for general non-Gaussian one-dimensional sample-mean sequences concern a different model and do not refute this statement. A stronger log-concavity extension and a central limit theorem are not counted as separate problems here. Current searches found no matching resolution or duplicate.
