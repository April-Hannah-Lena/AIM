# 661. Connectivity when the last isolated point disappears in a polytope

**Area:** Applied topology / stochastic geometry
**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL
**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

Fix $`d\ge3`$ and a compact convex polytope $`A\subset\mathbb R^d`$ with nonempty interior. Let $`X_1,X_2,\ldots`$ be independent points uniformly distributed in $`A`$. For $`n\ge2`$, let $`G_n(r)`$ have vertex set $`\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}`$ and join two vertices when their Euclidean distance is at most $`r`$.

Define

```math
L_n=\max_{1\le i\le n}\min_{j\ne i}\|X_i-X_j\|,
\qquad M_n=\inf\{r\ge0:G_n(r)\text{ is connected}\}.
```

Thus $`L_n`$ is the radius at which the graph first has no isolated vertices, and $`L_n\le M_n`$.

Is it true for every such polytope $`A`$ that

```math
\lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr\{L_n=M_n\}=1?
```

## Application

For a wireless network or a graph built from sampled data, the statement would make the disappearance of isolated points an asymptotically reliable certificate of global connectivity, including domains with sharp edges and corners.

## Status review

**Known cases:** The equality holds with probability tending to one for a cube. The later Penrose–Yang result proves it for convex polygons and for compact Euclidean domains with $`C^2`$ boundary. For every polytope in the question, the source already proves $`M_n/L_n\to1`$ almost surely.

**Remaining target:** Exact equality with high probability for arbitrary convex polytopes in dimension at least three; asymptotic equality of the ratio does not establish this.

Remark 2.9 explicitly identifies this extension beyond cubes. Current searches found no solution or announced proof for the general polytopal case.
