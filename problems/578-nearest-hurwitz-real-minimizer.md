# 578. A real nearest matrix with spectrum in the closed left half-plane

**Area:** Numerical linear algebra and matrix optimization

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

For $`\mathbb F\in\{\mathbb R,\mathbb C\}`$ and $`n\ge1`$, define

```math
\mathcal H_n(\mathbb F)=\{B\in\mathbb F^{n\times n}:\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\nolimits\lambda\le0\text{ for every }\lambda\in\sigma(B)\}.
```

For $`A\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}`$ put

```math
d_{\mathbb F}(A)=\min_{B\in\mathcal H_n(\mathbb F)}\|A-B\|_F,
```

where $`\|M\|_F^2=\sum_{i,j}|M_{ij}|^2`$.

Prove or disprove the Noferini–Poloni conjecture that

```math
d_{\mathbb R}(A)=d_{\mathbb C}(A)
```

for every real square matrix $`A`$. Equivalently, does the complex minimization problem always have a real global minimizer?

The admissible spectral region is the **closed** left half-plane. Eigenvalues on the imaginary axis may have arbitrary Jordan blocks; no semisimplicity condition is imposed. The minima exist because these feasible sets are nonempty and closed and the objective is coercive.

## Application

Approximating an unstable model by a nearby matrix with nonpositive spectral abscissa is a basic matrix correction problem in control and system identification. The conjecture asks whether allowing complex entries can ever improve the best achievable Frobenius error for real input data. It does not assert asymptotic or bounded dynamical behavior for every matrix on the boundary of the admissible set.

## Status review

The source provides numerical evidence and proves that a real minimizer gives a stationary point of the complex Schur-form optimization problem (Theorem 7.2). Stationarity does not prove global minimality over complex matrices. Taking the real part of a complex feasible matrix also need not preserve feasibility.

The current arXiv record retains version 2 from February 2021. The later Riemann-Oracle work develops numerical methods for matrix nearness problems, including distance to instability; its improved local optimization algorithms do not establish this real-global-minimizer conjecture.

The existing static-output-feedback stabilization problem concerns a different constrained family and is not equivalent.
