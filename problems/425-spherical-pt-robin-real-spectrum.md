# 425. Reality of the spectrum for a spherical strip with PT-symmetric boundary conditions

**Area:** Waveguides and nonselfadjoint boundary PDEs

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22
## Problem statement

For $`0<a<\pi/2`$, $`\alpha\in\mathbb R`$, and $`m\in\mathbb Z`$, put $`\beta=\tfrac12\tan a`$ and define on $`L^2(-a,a)`$

```math
H_{a,\alpha,m}u=-u''+\frac{8m^2-3-\cos(2x)}{8\cos^2x}\,u,
```



```math
D(H_{a,\alpha,m})=\{u\in H^2(-a,a):u'(\pm a)+(i\alpha\pm\beta)u(\pm a)=0\}.
```

Is $`\sigma(H_{a,\alpha,m})\subset\mathbb R`$ for every such triple? These separated operators represent the Laplace–Beltrami problem on a tubular neighborhood of the equator with the parity-and-time symmetric Robin conditions of the references.

## Application

Curved waveguides with balanced boundary gain and loss lead to nonselfadjoint modes. Spectral reality would identify a geometry in which this balance preserves real frequencies at every mode and boundary strength.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The paper proves reality for the comparison operator without its potential and for eigenvalues with sufficiently large real part. The remaining low-lying spectrum is the explicit question in the problem note. Searches for spherical PT Robin spectral reality and later Krejčiřík–Siegl work through the review date located no all-parameter proof or counterexample.
