# 191. Uniqueness of the planar spin-glass ground-state pair

**Area:** Disordered magnetic materials

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-08

## Problem statement

For each nearest-neighbor edge $e$ of $\mathbb Z^2$, sample $J_e$ independently from the standard Gaussian distribution. A spin configuration $\sigma\in\{-1,1\}^{\mathbb Z^2}$ is a ground state if flipping any finite set of spins cannot decrease its energy; explicitly,

$$
\sum_{\{x,y\}\in\partial_E A}J_{\{x,y\}}\sigma_x\sigma_y\ge0
\quad\text{for every finite }A\subset\mathbb Z^2,
$$

where $\partial_E A$ contains edges with exactly one endpoint in $A$. Is it almost surely true that the set of all ground states is exactly $\{\sigma,-\sigma\}$ for some $\sigma$? The assertion concerns all infinite-volume ground states, without restricting the boundary conditions used to construct them.

## Application

The number of stable zero-temperature phases determines whether a two-dimensional spin glass has a simple or complex energy landscape.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The 2024 paper explicitly retains uniqueness of the ground-state pair as a conjecture. Uniqueness with finite-volume continuous couplings, half-plane theorems, and statements about particular translation-covariant state selections are weaker than the full-plane assertion here.
