# 182. Does supercritical percolation preserve transience?

**Area:** Diffusion in diluted networks

**Status:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

**Last checked:** 2026-09-08

## Problem statement

Let $G$ be the Cayley graph of an infinite finitely generated group with a finite symmetric generating set. Assume simple random walk on $G$ is transient. For $p>p_c(G)$ retain each edge independently with probability $p$, where $p_c(G)$ is the infimum of parameters giving an infinite open component with positive probability. Must simple random walk on every infinite open component be transient, almost surely? Transience means that a walk starting at any vertex returns to it only finitely often almost surely.

## Applied significance

Random deletion of conducting bonds can create trapping and bottlenecks. The question asks whether dilution above the connectivity threshold can change long-time diffusion from transient to recurrent.

## Status review

The updated book retains the conjecture. It is known for Euclidean lattices in transient dimensions and for important nonamenable classes; those results do not cover all transient Cayley graphs. This entry restricts to strictly supercritical parameters and does not assert anything at criticality.

Search topics checked on 2026-09-08: `percolation transience Cayley conjecture 2025 2026; percolation preserves transience solved`. No later resolution of the exact statement was located; this is not a certification that no proof exists.
