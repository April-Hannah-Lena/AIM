# 502. Integral optimal flat-norm decompositions in codimension one

**Area:** Applied topology, geometric measure theory and shape comparison

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

## Problem statement

Let $`T`$ be a compactly supported integral $`d`$-current in $`\mathbb R^{d+1}`$, $`d\ge1`$. Thus $`T`$ and its boundary are integer-multiplicity rectifiable currents of finite mass. Write $`\mathbf M`$ for mass and define the real flat norm by

```math
\mathbb F(T)=\inf\{\mathbf M(X)+\mathbf M(S):T=X+\partial S,\ X\in\mathcal N_d^c,\ S\in\mathcal N_{d+1}^c\},
```

where $`\mathcal N_k^c`$ consists of compactly supported real normal $`k`$-currents in the same ambient space.

Must there exist compactly supported **integral** currents $`X_I`$ and $`S_I`$ such that

```math
T=X_I+\partial S_I,\qquad \mathbb F(T)=\mathbf M(X_I)+\mathbf M(S_I)?
```

The input is not required to satisfy $`\partial T=0`$. The question asks for at least one integral optimum of the real problem. Integrality of every optimum and optimality only within the integral class are different assertions.

## Application

The flat norm compares oriented shapes by balancing a residual against a filling. An integral optimum would preserve the integer-multiplicity interpretation of the input, supporting geometric interpretation of optimal decompositions and their discrete approximations.

## Status review

**Known cases:** Corollary 3.8 of [1] proves the result for integral one-currents in the plane. The introduction records the known case of codimension-one boundaries. Theorem 3.7 gives a conditional extension through the subdivision/approximation statement associated with Conjecture 3.4.

**Remaining target:** General compactly supported integral $`d`$-currents in $`\mathbb R^{d+1}`$ for $`d\ge2`$, allowing nonzero boundary, without assuming that subdivision conjecture.

The source's counterexamples in ambient dimension at least $`d+3`$ do not settle this codimension-one question. Searches on 23 September 2026 found no matching resolution or announcement. Later results concerning integral homogeneous flat norms or approximation of cycles have different targets.
