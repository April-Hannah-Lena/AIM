# 620. Spanning triangulated spheres with holes in surface triangulations

**Area:** Topological graph theory and rigidity

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

Let $`\mathbb S_g`$ be the sphere with $`g`$ pairwise disjoint open disks removed, with disjoint closures. A triangulation of a compact surface is an embedding of a finite simple graph, containing the surface boundary, such that every complementary face is an open disk bounded by a triangle.

The Euler genus of a closed orientable surface with $`h`$ handles is $`2h`$; that of a closed nonorientable surface with $`h`$ crosscaps is $`h`$.

Is it true that every triangulation $`G`$ of every closed connected surface of Euler genus $`g`$ contains a spanning subgraph that is a triangulation of $`\mathbb S_g`$? Spanning means retaining all vertices; no new vertices may be added.

## Application

Such spanning planar structures connect surface topology with rigidity in the plane. The conjecture strengthens the existence of spanning planar Laman subgraphs in surface triangulations.

## Status review

**Known cases:** The sphere, projective plane and torus cases are established. The source also proves the result for orientable surfaces when facewidth is sufficiently large, with a genus-dependent threshold.

**Remaining target:** Removing that hypothesis and treating arbitrary nonorientable surfaces remains open. The number of holes cannot be uniformly reduced below the Euler genus.
