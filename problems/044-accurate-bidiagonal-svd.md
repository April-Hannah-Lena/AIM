# 044. Accurate selected bidiagonal singular vectors in O(kn) work

**Area:** Numerical linear algebra and low-rank approximation

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-08

## Problem statement

Let $`B\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}`$ be upper bidiagonal, with singular values $`\sigma_1(B)\ge\cdots\ge\sigma_n(B)\ge0`$. Given $`k`$ distinct requested indices $`j_1,\ldots,j_k\in\{1,\ldots,n\}`$, construct a floating-point algorithm that computes corresponding singular triplets $`(\widehat\sigma_i,\widehat u_i,\widehat v_i)`$ in $`O(kn)`$ arithmetic operations, with unit vectors, nonnegative estimates, and

```math
|\widehat\sigma_i-\sigma_{j_i}(B)|\le C\epsilon n\|B\|_2,
```



```math
\|B\widehat v_i-\widehat\sigma_i\widehat u_i\|_2\le C\epsilon n\|B\|_2,
```



```math
\|B^T\widehat u_i-\widehat\sigma_i\widehat v_i\|_2\le C\epsilon n\|B\|_2,
```



```math
|\widehat u_i^T\widehat u_j|\le C\epsilon n,\qquad
|\widehat v_i^T\widehat v_j|\le C\epsilon n\quad(i\ne j).
```

Here $`\epsilon`$ is unit roundoff and $`C`$ is a universal constant, independent of singular-value gaps or clusters; assume $`\epsilon n`$ is small and exclude overflow and underflow. A repeated value permits any orthonormal basis of its singular subspace.

## Application

Dense SVD algorithms reduce their input to bidiagonal form. A reliably accurate linear-work-per-vector final stage would improve selected SVD computations used for compression and scientific data analysis.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located

Checked on **2026-09-08**. Problem 3.8 still asks for the combined work, residual and orthogonality guarantees. This entry makes the intended selected-SVD task explicit by requiring both singular-vector equations and accuracy at the requested ordered indices; the source displays only the first residual equation. Earlier O(n²) titles alone do not establish reliable implementations for clustered spectra. No later solution was located.

Searches included: `bidiagonal O(kn) 2026 SVD`; `bidiagonal SVD MR 2026`; `bidiagonal SVD residual orthogonality open problem`. This is a documented literature check, not a certification that no solution exists.
