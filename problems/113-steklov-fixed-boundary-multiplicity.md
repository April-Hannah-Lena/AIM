# 113. Unbounded first Steklov multiplicity with fixed boundary count

**Area:** Boundary-mode degeneracy

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-08

## Problem statement

Does there exist a fixed integer $b\ge1$ and a sequence of smooth compact connected orientable Riemannian surfaces $(M_j,g_j)$, each with exactly $b$ boundary components, such that

$$
\dim\{u:\Delta_{g_j}u=0,\ \partial_\nu u=\sigma_1(M_j,g_j)u\}\longrightarrow\infty?
$$

Here $\sigma_1$ is the first positive eigenvalue of the ordinary, unweighted Steklov problem. The genus and metric may vary; $b$ must not vary. Boundary length may be normalized to one by scaling.

## Application

This asks whether arbitrarily many lowest boundary-vibration modes can coincide while the number of boundary components stays fixed, by increasing interior topology.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Audet-Beaumont proves arbitrarily large first multiplicity when the number of boundary components also grows. Remark 1.3 separates the still-open fixed-count question. Fixed-genus upper bounds explain why the allowed genus must grow, and do not rule out the sequence asked for here.

**Search audit:** “Steklov arbitrarily large multiplicity fixed number boundary components”; “Audet Beaumont Remark 1.3 2026”. Searches included proof, counterexample, and 2025–2026 updates. No later resolution of the stated problem was located; this is a literature review, not a proof of openness.
