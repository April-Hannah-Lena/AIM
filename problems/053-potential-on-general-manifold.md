# 053 — Recover a potential on a general known Riemannian manifold

**Area:** Inverse boundary problems / anisotropic wave media

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-08

## Problem statement

Let $`(M,g)`$ be any known compact connected smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension $`n\geq3`$ with smooth nonempty boundary. For real $`q\in C^\infty(M)`$, assume zero is not a Dirichlet eigenvalue of $`-\Delta_g+q`$. Define

```math
\Lambda_{g,q}f=\partial_{\nu_g}u|_{\partial M},\qquad
(-\Delta_g+q)u=0,\quad u|_{\partial M}=f.
```

Must $`\Lambda_{g,q_1}=\Lambda_{g,q_2}`$ imply $`q_1=q_2`$ for every such manifold and pair of potentials? The metric is fixed and known; the map is measured at the single frequency zero.

## Application

This separates recovery of an absorption or reaction coefficient from recovery of a known anisotropic background geometry in boundary imaging.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located

Both references explicitly distinguish the open smooth higher-dimensional fixed-frequency potential problem from results in special geometries. Reference 2 proves a high-frequency theorem under a stable ray-transform hypothesis; neither high frequency nor that geometry is assumed here. Full frequency-dependent data would constitute a stronger experiment.

On 2026-09-08 the review searched `potential general Riemannian manifold open problem inverse`, `Calderón potential arbitrary open problem`, and the exact title of reference 2 with `2025 2026`. No resolution on an arbitrary known smooth manifold at the stated single frequency was located.
