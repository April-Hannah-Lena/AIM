# 309. The Li–Li multiple-unicast conjecture

## Problem statement

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite connected undirected graph with capacities $c_e\geq0$. Specify finitely many sessions $(s_i,t_i)$, with $s_i\ne t_i$. Session $i$ has its own independent message, initially known at $s_i$, and requests its exact recovery at $t_i$.

Use noiseless links and causal network coding: each transmitted symbol may be any function of the sender's initial messages and previously received symbols. Both directions of an edge share its capacity. Define the zero-error throughput region $\mathcal C_{\mathrm{NC}}$ by arbitrary finite block protocols and asymptotic packet scaling: at scale $b$, messages have $br_i$ symbols and edge $e$ carries at most $bc_e$ symbols in total, with integer rounding and closure as $b\to\infty$. A common finite alphabet may be chosen for each protocol. There is no additional completion-time constraint.

For each session, let $\mathcal P_i$ be its set of simple source-to-destination paths. Its fractional routing region is

$$
\mathcal C_{\mathrm{MCF}}=
\left\{r\geq0:\ \exists x_{i,P}\geq0,\quad
\sum_{P\in\mathcal P_i}x_{i,P}\geq r_i\ \text{for all }i,\quad
\sum_i\sum_{\substack{P\in\mathcal P_i\\e\in P}}x_{i,P}\leq c_e\ \text{for all }e
\right\}.
$$

Is $\mathcal C_{\mathrm{NC}}=\mathcal C_{\mathrm{MCF}}$ for every such graph, capacity assignment and session collection? Equivalently, can coding ever increase independent-unicast throughput over fractional routing? Coding need not be linear, and terminal locations may be shared across sessions. [1, 2, 5]

## Application

The question determines whether routers can increase sustained data-transfer rates by mixing independent streams instead of optimally splitting and forwarding packets. It connects the information-theoretic performance of a bidirectional communication network to a multicommodity-flow optimization problem. [1, 2]

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The August 2026 formulation [2] still treats the general conjecture as open. Its positive results restrict the terminal count, planar embedding, session pattern or number of coding nodes; its final reduction is conditional. Independent corroboration [3] explicitly distinguishes the unresolved unicast problem from its multicast separation. Multicast lets several destinations request the same message and is a different demand model.

The interaction framework [4] gives an equivalence and sufficient structural conditions, leaving universal independence of irreducible cores unproved. The completion-time separation [5] concerns finite packet demands; it does not establish an asymptotic throughput separation. The undecidability theorem [6] uses directed acyclic networks with general message demands and does not settle this undirected subclass. The equivalent transmission-cost formulation is included in this single entry.

The [evidence record](../research/expansion-2026-09/candidates/li-li-multiple-unicast.json) documents exact searches, source access, scope comparisons, duplicate screening and the separate adversarial self-review.

The September 17, 2026 review included named and mathematical formulations, author/citation searches, 2025–2026 results, and unrestricted proof, counterexample, resolution and correction searches; these were refreshed before integration.
