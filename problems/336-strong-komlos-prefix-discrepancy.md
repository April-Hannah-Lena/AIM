# 336. A constant bound for fixed-order prefix discrepancy

**Area:** Discrepancy, cumulative allocation and integer optimization

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-18

## Problem statement

Does there exist an absolute constant $C>0$ with the following property? For every pair of positive integers $d,T$ and every ordered sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_T\in\mathbb R^d$ with Euclidean norms $\|v_i\|_2\le1$, one can choose signs $\varepsilon_1,\ldots,\varepsilon_T\in\{-1,1\}$ such that

$$
\max_{1\le k\le T}
\left\|\sum_{i=1}^{k}\varepsilon_i v_i\right\|_\infty
\le C,
\qquad
\|z\|_\infty=\max_{1\le j\le d}|z_j|?
$$

The order is fixed. The signs may depend on the entire sequence, but the same signs must work for every prefix and coordinate. The constant must be independent of $d$, $T$ and the vectors. This is the strong, or prefix, Komlós conjecture. No online decision rule or efficient algorithm is required. [1, 2]

Taking $k=T$ gives the ordinary terminal-sum question in [entry 031](031-komlos.md). Controlling each prefix with a separately chosen signing would not answer the stronger question here.

## Application

View each vector as the feature or resource contributions of one indivisible item in a prescribed sequence. Its sign assigns it to one of two groups. The prefix sums then measure cumulative imbalance at each stage, so the conjecture asks for a uniform buffer independent of the number of items and tracked resources. Equivalently, putting $x_i=(1+\varepsilon_i)/2$ rounds a half-allocation to whole items with coordinate error at most $C/2$ at every prefix. These are interpretations of the stated model. Prefix discrepancy also feeds into Steinitz rearrangement bounds, which have applications in integer programming and scheduling. [1, §1] An existence result alone would not supply an efficient allocation algorithm.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Open in cited literature; no later resolution located as of 2026-09-18. The independently authored source [2, Conjecture 1.6] explicitly retains this question. The September manuscripts [2, 3] claim universal constants for the final sum and explicitly distinguish that result from controlling all prefixes.

For general fixed inputs, [4, Theorem 2] gives an $O(\sqrt{\log(2T)})$ prefix bound at fixed positive success probability, with an online algorithm. Its online optimality does not establish an offline lower bound. The smoothed-input theorem and branching-path counterexamples in [1] change, respectively, the input assumptions and the family of constraints.

The constant bounds in [5] require sufficiently small coordinates; their failure estimates can be vacuous without that restriction. Its lower bound concerns online signing, while the signs here may use future vectors. Source [6] permits discarding some terms, which this question forbids.

The [evidence record](../research/expansion-2026-09/candidates/strong-komlos-prefix-discrepancy.json) also compares complex colors, adaptive games, partial colorings and structured flow/assignment rounding at full relevant statement level. Historical results were read through explicit scholarly restatements where noted. Source research and a separated adversarial self-pass examine scope and status, without certifying the complete technical proofs.

A publication refresh on September 18, 2026 rechecked status and upstream duplicates; see the [batch 4 audit](../research/expansion-2026-09/batch-04-review.md). No matching later resolution was located.
