# 220. A spectral gap for almost every pair of quantum gates

**Area:** Spectral theory / quantum dynamics

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-13

## Problem statement

Let $G=\mathrm{SU}(2)=\{U\in\mathbb C^{2\times2}:U^*U=I,\det U=1\}$, with Haar probability measure $\mu$. For $a,b\in G$, define the lazy averaging operator on $L^2(G,\mu)$ by
$$
P_{a,b}f(g)=\frac12 f(g)+\frac18\bigl(f(ag)+f(a^{-1}g)+f(bg)+f(b^{-1}g)\bigr).
$$
Is it true that for $(\mu\otimes\mu)$-almost every pair $(a,b)$ there exists $\delta(a,b)>0$ such that
$$
\|P_{a,b}f\|_2\le(1-\delta(a,b))\|f\|_2
\quad\text{whenever }f\in L^2(G,\mu),\quad\int_G f\,d\mu=0?
$$
The gap may depend on the chosen pair; no positive bound uniform over all pairs is requested.

## Application

Two single-qubit gates and their inverses generate a random quantum circuit. The conjecture asks whether almost every fixed gate pair makes square-integrable deviations from the uniform distribution decay exponentially with circuit length.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The March 2026 paper proves that the set of pairs with a gap has either zero or full Haar measure. It does not determine which alternative holds. Results for algebraic generators establish many examples but do not give positive Haar measure. The lazy averaging formulation above is equivalent to the spectral-gap property defined in that paper.

**Search audit:** Searched “spectral gap SU(2) almost every pair proof 2026”, “Pikhurko Sakamoto spectral gap conjecture”, and subsequent work citing the zero–one law. Searches included later proofs, counterexamples, and 2025–2026 updates. No resolution matching the stated hypotheses was located.
