# 400. Concentric-ball optimality for thermal insulation with radiative heat transfer

**Area:** Elliptic PDEs / nonlinear boundary laws

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Fix $`n\ge2`$, $`\beta>0`$, $`\gamma\ge0`$ and $`R>1`$, and put

```math
\Theta(s)=\beta\left(s^5/5+\gamma s^4+2\gamma^2s^3+2\gamma^3s^2\right).
```

For a bounded Lipschitz open set $`\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n`$ and a measurable $`K\subset\Omega`$, define

```math
E_\Theta(K,\Omega)=\min_{\substack{v\in H^1(\Omega),\ 0\le v\le1\\v=1\ {\rm a.e.\ on}\ K}}\left(\int_\Omega|\nabla v|^2dx+\int_{\partial\Omega}\Theta(v)d\mathcal H^{n-1}\right).
```

Writing $`\omega_n=|B_1|`$, is the inequality

```math
E_\Theta(K,\Omega)\ge\min_{1\le r\le R}E_\Theta(B_1,B_r)
```

valid whenever $`|K|=\omega_n`$ and $`|\Omega|\le\omega_nR^n`$? For $`r=1`$ the right side uses $`K=\Omega=B_1`$, so unused insulation is allowed.

## Application

The boundary law represents Stefan–Boltzmann radiation into an environment at nonnegative temperature. The inequality would justify spherical designs when both the heated body and the amount of insulating material can be arranged freely.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The primary source singles out radiative heat transfer as an unresolved instance of its constrained-volume concentric-ball question. It proves the quadratic convection law, all penalized-volume problems, and some inactive-constraint cases; those results do not establish the displayed inequality for the radiative law under an arbitrary volume budget. Searches through 22 September 2026 for nonlinear radiative insulation shape optimization and later work by the authors found no resolution.
