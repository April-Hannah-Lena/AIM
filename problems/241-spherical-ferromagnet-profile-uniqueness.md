# 241. Uniqueness of a hemispheric saddle profile on a magnetic sphere

**Area:** Curved-film micromagnetics

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-13

## Problem statement

For $`\kappa\geq4`$, consider the energy

```math
\mathcal E_\kappa(m)=\frac12\int_{S^2}[|\nabla_{S^2}m|^2+\kappa(1-(m(x)\cdot x)^2)]\,dS,
```

for unit magnetization fields $`m:S^2\to S^2`$. Write an axisymmetric field in spherical coordinates as $`m(\theta,\varphi)=(\sin h(\theta)\cos\varphi,\sin h(\theta)\sin\varphi,\cos h(\theta))`$.

Is there exactly one profile $`h\in C^\infty([0,\pi])`$, inducing a smooth map on the whole sphere, that satisfies

```math
h''+\cot\theta\,h'-\frac{\sin(2h)}{2\sin^2\theta}-\frac\kappa2\sin(2h-2\theta)=0\quad(0<\theta<\pi),
```



```math
h(0)=0,\qquad h(\pi)=2\pi,\qquad h(\pi-\theta)=2\pi-h(\theta)?
```

These boundary and reflection conditions specify the hemispheric class with one complete profile rotation; the corresponding map has degree zero.

## Application

Curvature can support magnetic configurations that differ from planar-film patterns. Uniqueness would determine whether two known constructions describe the same saddle configuration for a spherical shell.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Searched “Saddle Point Configurations spherical ferromagnets uniqueness 2026”, “spherical ferromagnet H_0,2 unique critical profile conjecture proof”, and the journal publication. Remark 3.18 expressly conjectures uniqueness for all $`\kappa\geq4`$. Existence and local continuation near the explicit $`\kappa=4`$ profile do not prove global uniqueness in this class. No later proof or counterexample was located.
