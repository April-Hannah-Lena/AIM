# 417. An algebraic vanishing-noise rate for kinetic mean-field games

**Area:** Kinetic PDEs / mean-field games

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Fix $d\ge1$, $T>0$, and a smooth nonnegative compactly supported probability density $m_{\rm in}$ on $Q=\mathbb T^d\times\mathbb R^d$. For each $0\le\nu\le1$, let $m_\nu$ be the density component minimizing
$$\mathcal J(m,a)=\int_0^T\!\int_Q\left(\frac{|a|^2}{2m}+\frac{m^2}{2}\right)dx\,dv\,dt+\frac12\int_Q m(T)^2dx\,dv$$
subject to
$$\partial_tm+v\cdot\nabla_xm-\nu\Delta_vm+\nabla_v\cdot a=0,\qquad m(0)=m_{\rm in}.$$
Admissible pairs have narrowly continuous probability densities with finite second velocity moment, the equation holds distributionally, and $\mathcal J<\infty$; use $|a|^2/m=0$ at $(m,a)=(0,0)$ and $+\infty$ when $m=0$, $a\ne0$. Does there exist an exponent $\eta=\eta(d)>0$ such that for every such datum and horizon some $C<\infty$, independent of $\nu$, satisfies
$$\|m_\nu-m_0\|_{L^2((0,T)\times Q)}\le C\nu^\eta\qquad(0<\nu\le1)?$$

## Application

Here agents control acceleration, and noise diffuses their velocities. The variational formulation is a local-congestion kinetic mean-field game; a rate would quantify the error introduced by stochastic regularization of deterministic traffic and crowd models.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The SIAM source explicitly asks for kinetic vanishing-viscosity rates. This formulation selects the quadratic acceleration and linear local-congestion case and defines the density through a strictly convex variational problem, including the inviscid density. The 2022 work establishes the underlying first-order variational theory, not a noise-dependent approximation rate. Searches through 22 September 2026 for kinetic MFG viscosity rates and acceleration-control convergence found no matching result.
