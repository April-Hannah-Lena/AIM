# 197. The bosonic Laughlin contact-interaction gap

**Area:** Fractional quantum Hall physics

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-13

## Problem statement

Let $\mathcal P_N$ be the symmetric complex polynomials in $z_1,\ldots,z_N$ of total degree at most $N(N-1)$, with inner product

$$\langle F,G\rangle=\pi^{-N}\int_{\mathbb C^N}\overline{F(z)}G(z)e^{-\sum_j|z_j|^2}\,dz.$$

On the full polynomial space define the orthogonal projection

$$(P_{ij}F)(z)=F\left(z_1,\ldots,\frac{z_i+z_j}{2},\ldots,\frac{z_i+z_j}{2},\ldots,z_N\right).$$

The sum $H_N=\sum_{i<j}P_{ij}$ preserves $\mathcal P_N$. Its kernel contains the Laughlin polynomial $\prod_{i<j}(z_i-z_j)^2$. Does there exist $c>0$ such that, for every $N\ge2$,

$$\inf\big(\sigma(H_N|_{\mathcal P_N})\setminus\{0\}\big)\ge c?$$

This fixes the contact-interaction normalization and the angular-momentum cutoff while letting particle number grow.

## Application

The gap protects a correlated quantum Hall fluid against low-energy perturbations. The same model describes rapidly rotating ultracold bosons restricted to the lowest Landau level.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The selected case is the full lowest-Landau-level contact interaction, with the degree cutoff used in Rougerie’s conjecture. Results for truncated pseudopotentials or thin-cylinder limits change the Hamiltonian or geometry. The 2024 paper “The charge gap is greater than the neutral gap in fractional quantum Hall systems” (arXiv:2410.11645) explicitly still treats the full pseudopotential gap as open; comparing two gaps does not prove a positive lower bound.

**Search audit:** “Laughlin spectral gap conjecture full contact pseudopotential proof 2025 2026”; “2410.11645 Haldane conjecture neutral gap”. Searches included later proofs, counterexamples, and 2025–2026 updates. No resolution matching the stated hypotheses was located.
