# 117. Linear growth of interior Steklov nodal volume

**Area:** Boundary-driven wave patterns

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

**Last checked:** 2026-09-08

## Problem statement

Let $(M,g)$ be any smooth compact connected $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with smooth nonempty boundary, $d\ge2$. For a real nonzero Steklov eigenfunction

$$\Delta_g u=0\text{ in }M,\qquad\partial_\nu u=\sigma u\text{ on }\partial M,\qquad\sigma>0,$$

write $Z_u=\{x\in\operatorname{int}M:u(x)=0\}$. Prove or disprove that there are constants $0<c_M\le C_M<\infty$, independent of $u$ and $\sigma$, such that

$$c_M\sigma\le\mathcal H^{d-1}_g(Z_u)\le C_M\sigma.$$

Only the nodal set inside the medium is counted; the boundary trace has a different-dimensional zero set.

## Application

Nodal interfaces partition the interior of a boundary-loaded vibrating medium. The proposed law predicts their total size directly from the boundary spectral frequency.

## Status review

**Known cases:** The two-sided linear interior nodal-length estimate is established for real-analytic Riemannian surfaces.

**Remaining target:** The corresponding two-sided interior nodal-volume estimate for every smooth manifold in every dimension at least two.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The analytic two-dimensional case is established. The 2024 survey asks for the general smooth estimates. The April 2026 paper improves estimates for boundary nodal sets and does not establish the displayed two-sided interior estimate.

**Search audit:** “Steklov interior nodal volume linear bound conjecture”; “Steklov eigenfunctions nodal 2026”; “smooth Steklov Yau nodal bounds”. Searches included proof, counterexample, and 2025–2026 updates. No later resolution of the stated problem was located; this is a literature review, not a proof of openness.
