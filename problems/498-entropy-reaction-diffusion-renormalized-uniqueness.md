# 498. Unconditional uniqueness for entropy-dissipating reaction–diffusion

**Area:** Reaction–diffusion PDEs; chemical kinetics

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

## Problem statement

Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$, $d\ge2$, be bounded with smooth boundary, and let $N\ge2$, $d_i>0$. Let $f:[0,\infty)^N\to\mathbb R^N$ be locally Lipschitz, with $f_i(z)\ge0$ when $z_i=0$, and suppose some $\mu\in\mathbb R^N$ satisfies
$$\sum_i f_i(z)(\log z_i+\mu_i)\le0\qquad(z_i>0).$$
No growth bound on $f$ is imposed. For nonnegative $u_0$ with $\sum_i\int_\Omega u_{i,0}(1+|\log u_{i,0}|)<\infty$, is the renormalized solution of
$$\partial_tu_i=d_i\Delta u_i+f_i(u),\qquad\partial_\nu u_i=0,\qquad u_i(0)=u_{i,0},$$
unique?

Precisely, the comparison class consists of nonnegative $u_i\in L^\infty(0,T;L^1)$, $\sqrt{u_i}\in L^2(0,T;H^1)$ for every $T<\infty$, such that for each smooth $\xi:[0,\infty)^N\to\mathbb R$ with compactly supported $D\xi$, each smooth $\psi$ on $\overline\Omega\times[0,T]$, and almost every $T$,
$$\begin{aligned}
\int_\Omega\xi(u(T))\psi(T)-\int_\Omega\xi(u_0)\psi(0)-\int_0^T\!\int_\Omega\xi(u)\partial_t\psi
={}&-\sum_{i,j}d_i\int_0^T\!\int_\Omega\psi\xi_{ij}(u)\nabla u_i\cdot\nabla u_j\\
&-\sum_i d_i\int_0^T\!\int_\Omega\xi_i(u)\nabla u_i\cdot\nabla\psi
+\sum_i\int_0^T\!\int_\Omega\xi_i(u)f_i(u)\psi .
\end{aligned}$$
Products of gradients are interpreted using $\nabla u_i=2\sqrt{u_i}\nabla\sqrt{u_i}$; the cutoff makes all displayed terms integrable. The question is equality almost everywhere of any two such solutions with the same initial data, without assuming that a bounded strong solution exists.

## Application

General reaction networks already admit global renormalized concentration fields. Uniqueness would make these weak predictions independent of the approximation used to construct them.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Fischer proves uniqueness conditional on a strong solution, while the 2023 discussion and the August 2026 preprint explicitly retain unconditional uniqueness as unresolved. Searches on 2026-09-22 for renormalized reaction–diffusion uniqueness found further weak–strong results, including interface problems, but no unconditional theorem for this entropy class. This question fixes linear diffusion and concerns uniqueness; it does not restate the separate smooth-existence question for high-order mass-action reactions.
