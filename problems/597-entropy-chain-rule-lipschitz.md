## Problem statement

Let $`\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d`$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain, $`T>0`$, $`V\in C^2(\overline\Omega)`$ and $`\pi=e^{-V}`$. Define

```math
E(\rho)=\int_\Omega(\rho\log\rho-\rho+1+\rho V)\,dx,
```

with $`0\log0=0`$. Consider nonnegative densities $`\rho\in C([0,T];L^1_w(\Omega))`$ of fixed positive mass, and a flux $`F\in L^1((0,T)\times\Omega;\mathbb R^d)`$. Here $`L^1_w`$ carries its weak topology. Assume $`E(\rho(0))<\infty`$ and the continuity equation with no boundary flux, in the precise weak form

```math
\int_0^T\!\int_\Omega(\rho\,\partial_t\varphi+F\cdot\nabla\varphi)\,dx\,dt
=\int_\Omega\rho(T)\varphi(T)\,dx-\int_\Omega\rho(0)\varphi(0)\,dx
```

for every $`\varphi\in C^1([0,T]\times\overline\Omega)`$. Suppose moreover that the kinetic action and Fisher information are finite:

```math
\int_0^T\!\int_\Omega\left(\frac{|F|^2}{\rho}+4\pi\left|\nabla\sqrt{\rho/\pi}\right|^2\right)\,dx\,dt<\infty.
```

The quotient is zero at $`(\rho,F)=(0,0)`$ and infinite when $`\rho=0`$, $`F\ne0`$; the Fisher term requires $`\sqrt{\rho/\pi}\in H^1(\Omega)`$ almost everywhere in time.

Prove or disprove that $`t\mapsto E(\rho(t))`$ is absolutely continuous and satisfies

```math
\frac{d}{dt}E(\rho(t))=\int_\Omega F(t)\cdot\nabla\log(\rho(t)/\pi)\,dx\quad\text{for almost every }t.
```

Interpret the integrand as

```math
(F/\sqrt\rho)\cdot(2\nabla\sqrt\rho+\sqrt\rho\,\nabla V),
```

with $`F/\sqrt\rho=0`$ on $`\{\rho=0\}`$. The stated estimates make this integrable. The target is Proposition A.1 of [1] for general Lipschitz domains, including those that are both nonconvex and nonsmooth, without additional bounds on the density or gradient-approximation assumptions.

## Application

This chain rule identifies limits satisfying an energy-dissipation inequality as solutions of the Fokker–Planck equation. Extending it would support convergence proofs for structure-preserving diffusion schemes on meshes of nonconvex polygonal and polyhedral domains.

## Status review

**Known cases:** The convex-domain result is established in [1]. For smooth nonconvex domains, [2] proves an upper chain rule for the unweighted entropy, and an exact rule assuming that $`\nabla\log\rho`$ belongs to the $`L^2(\rho\,dx)`$ closure of gradients of $`C^1`$ functions. Its Lemma A.3 verifies that extra condition for densities bounded above and away from zero.

**Remaining target:** Establish the exact rule under only the hypotheses above on arbitrary bounded Lipschitz domains. The discussion in [2] explicitly leaves the extension to Lipschitz geometry for future work; its smooth-domain result does not settle this target.
