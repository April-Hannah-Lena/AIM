# 437. Radial classification of higher-degree entire planar Ginzburg–Landau vortices

**Area:** Elliptic PDEs and superfluid vortices

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22
## Problem statement

Let $`u\in C^\infty(\mathbb R^2;\mathbb C)`$ satisfy

```math
-\Delta u=u(1-|u|^2),\qquad \lim_{|x|\to\infty}|u(x)|=1,
```

and let its degree on sufficiently large circles be an integer $`q\ge2`$. Must there exist $`x_0\in\mathbb R^2`$ and $`\alpha\in\mathbb C`$, $`|\alpha|=1`$, such that

```math
u(x_0+re^{i\theta})=\alpha e^{iq\theta}g_q(r)?
```

Here $`g_q`$ is the positive radial vortex profile solving $`g_q''+r^{-1}g_q'-q^2r^{-2}g_q+g_q(1-g_q^2)=0`$, $`g_q(0)=0`$, $`g_q(r)\to1`$. A single nonradial entire solution in this class would disprove the assertion.

## Application

The degree is the quantized circulation of a vortex. Classifying stationary states tests whether an isolated multiple-quantum vortex can support a noncircular equilibrium structure.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The source explicitly discusses why an earlier proposed symmetry-breaking construction does not settle this question. Searches through the review date for entire isotropic Ginzburg–Landau vortices, degree-two symmetry and Brezis Problem 2.4 found no later resolution. The September 2026 preprint [arXiv:2609.19020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.19020) claims finite potential energy from the asymptotic modulus condition (Problem 2.5), not the radial classification in Problem 2.4. Disk minimizer results, anisotropic systems, and magnetic vortices also have different hypotheses.
