## Problem statement

Let $A,B,C,D$ be arbitrary finite-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces. A density operator is a positive semidefinite operator of trace one. For a density operator $\rho_{AB}$, define its entanglement of purification by

$$
E_P(A:B)_\rho=
\min_{A',B',\,\psi}
S\!\left(\operatorname{Tr}_{BB'}|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\right),
\qquad
\operatorname{Tr}_{A'B'}|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|=\rho_{AB}.
$$

The minimum ranges over finite-dimensional auxiliary spaces $A',B'$ and unit vectors $\psi$ on $A\otimes A'\otimes B\otimes B'$. Here $\operatorname{Tr}$ with subsystem subscripts denotes partial trace, and

$$
S(\tau)=-\operatorname{Tr}(\tau\log_2\tau),\qquad 0\log_2 0=0,
$$

is the von Neumann entropy. The minimum is attained; no particular purification or auxiliary dimension is prescribed in the optimization.

For every pair of density operators $\rho_{AB}$ and $\sigma_{CD}$, is

$$
E_P(AC:BD)_{\rho\otimes\sigma}
=E_P(A:B)_\rho+E_P(C:D)_\sigma?
$$

The left-hand side groups $A,C$ with one party and $B,D$ with the other, and allows arbitrary joint purifications. Products of separate minimizing purifications give the $\le$ direction. The question is whether strict inequality ever occurs. It concerns the ordinary von Neumann entropy and includes all mixed states; classical states and identical factors are special cases of this one question.

## Application

Two separated laboratories can prepare many copies of a correlated state using shared maximally entangled qubit pairs, local operations and a communication rate tending to zero. The optimal asymptotic number of pairs consumed per copy is

$$
E_P^\infty(A:B)_\rho
=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}E_P(A^n:B^n)_{\rho^{\otimes n}}.
$$

This is a cost for creating both classical and quantum correlations. General additivity would identify it with the one-copy quantity $E_P$. A rigorous counterexample would show that optimizing preparations jointly can save resources relative to separate purifications. The operational result concerns vanishing communication rate, with preparation error tending to zero.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Chen–Winter explicitly formulate the general question and give strong numerical evidence against additivity for two-qubit Werner states. Their Theorem 3 proves a convexity property of the regularized quantity minus entropy. The numerical minimization supplies feasible upper bounds; the missing rigorous lower bound for the one-copy optimum is acknowledged in §IV. Their title therefore does not constitute a rigorous counterexample to the displayed equality. Bagchi–Pati prove the general upper-bound direction and retain the strict-inequality question.

The August 2026 Negari–Baghali Khanian preprint explicitly retains the von Neumann problem. Its analytic counterexamples apply to Rényi orders $0\le\alpha<1$. Appendix C.2 explains why the construction does not pass uniformly to $\alpha=1$. Its additivity theorem concerns $\alpha\ge2$ and a classical two-qubit factor. Its exact one-copy formula for classical two-qubit states does not solve the joint optimization for their tensor products. Faraji–Baghali Khanian prove order-two results for specified channel families; §V leaves the Werner-state channel reformulation unresolved. These results do not decide the general von Neumann equality.
