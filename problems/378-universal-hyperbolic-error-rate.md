## Problem statement

Let $f\in C^4(U;\mathbb R^N)$ be strictly hyperbolic near $0\in U$, with every characteristic field genuinely nonlinear, and a uniformly strictly convex entropy pair $(\eta,q)$ satisfying $Dq=D\eta Df$. Write $S_tu_0$ for its standard small-total-variation entropy solution of $u_t+f(u)_x=0$ on $\mathbb R$. Fix $T,R,M>0$ and sufficiently small $\delta>0$.
For $0<\varepsilon<e^{-1}$ consider every approximate flow $u:[0,T]\to L^1(\mathbb R;U)$ supported in $[-R,R]$ with $\sup_t\operatorname{TV}u(t)\le\delta$, $\|u(0)-u_0\|_1\le\varepsilon$ and $\|u(t)-u(s)\|_1\le M|t-s|+\varepsilon$. For a scalar test function $\phi\in C_c^1(\mathbb R^2)$ define
$$\mathcal R_{g,h}(s,t;\phi)=\int g(u(s,x))\phi(s,x)\,dx-\int g(u(t,x))\phi(t,x)\,dx+\int_s^t\!\int[g(u)\phi_t+h(u)\phi_x]\,dx\,dr.$$
Assume, for all $0\le s<t\le T$,
$$|\mathcal R_{\mathrm{id},f}|\le\varepsilon(t-s+\varepsilon)\|\phi\|_{W^{1,\infty}},\qquad\mathcal R_{\eta,q}\ge-\varepsilon(t-s+\varepsilon)\|\phi\|_{W^{1,\infty}}\quad(\phi\ge0).$$
Is there $C=C(f,\eta,U,\delta,T,R,M)$ such that every such approximation satisfies
$$\sup_{0\le t\le T}\|u(t)-S_tu_0\|_1\le C\sqrt\varepsilon\,|\log\varepsilon|?$$

## Applied significance

A universal bound would certify computed shock flows using measured conservation residuals, entropy residuals and total variation, without tying the certificate to one particular numerical scheme.

## Status review

Checked on 22 September 2026 using Bressan's universal convergence-rate problem, approximate entropy solutions and the square-root logarithmic rate. Compactness and uniqueness give some modulus tending to zero, without the displayed rate. The SIAM theorem concerns actual viscous approximations, which are a smaller class. The 2026 Glimm–Lax uniqueness advance concerns regularization and uniqueness for rough exact solutions, not residual-based quantitative estimates. No proof of the displayed universal bound or a counterexample was located. In the residual definition the terminal test value is at time $t$, as required by the weak conservation law.
