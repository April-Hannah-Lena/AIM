## Problem statement

Let $`S^2=\{x\in\mathbb R^3:\|x\|_2=1\}`$, equipped with chordal Euclidean distance. For any six-element subset $`X\subset S^2`$ and $`x\in X`$, let $`r_1(x)\ge r_2(x)`$ be the largest and second-largest of the five distances from $`x`$ to $`X\setminus\{x\}`$, counting ties. Set

```math
b(X)=\max_{x\in X}r_2(x),\qquad d(X)=\min_{x\in X}r_1(x).
```

Define

```math
\mathcal P=\{(b(X),d(X)):X\subset S^2,\ |X|=6,\ b(X)<d(X)\}.
```

Prove or refute the Gómez–Mémoli conjecture

```math
\mathcal P=\left\{(b,d):0<b<d\le2,\quad d\le\frac{2b}{\sqrt3}\ \text{or}\ \frac{4b^2(3-b^2)}{4-b^2}\le d^2\right\}.
```

The denominator is positive because $`b<d\le2`$.

Equivalently, $`\mathcal P`$ is the set of nonzero degree-two persistence pairs obtainable from samples of at most six points on $`S^2`$: at scale $`t`$, the Vietoris–Rips complex includes every simplex of diameter at most $`t`$. With coefficients in any field, such a sample has either no degree-two interval or the single interval $`[b(X),d(X))`$; fewer than six points cannot contribute one.

## Application

Persistence sets combine the topological summaries of many small samples. Characterizing this basic spherical example would give an exact benchmark for geometric shape descriptors computed from subsamples, whose cost can be much lower than that of the full data set.

## Status review

Proposition 5.24 realizes every pair in the displayed proposed region. The unresolved direction excludes additional pairs from arbitrary six-point configurations; numerical samples support it but do not prove it. This is a finite-sample chordal question, distinct from the full-sphere Vietoris–Rips transition in problem 522.
