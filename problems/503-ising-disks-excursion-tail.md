## Problem statement

For $`z\in\mathbb Z^2`$, put $`Q_z=z+[-1/2,1/2]^2`$. A finite collection $`C`$ of squares is a *clump* if its union $`|C|`$ is contractible and regular: every $`x\in|C|`$ is either interior or has $`(B_\varepsilon(x)\cap|C|)\setminus\{x\}`$ contractible for all sufficiently small $`\varepsilon>0`$.

Pin $`Q_0`$. A removal of $`Q\ne Q_0`$ is allowed if $`C\setminus\{Q\}`$ is a clump and $`|C|`$ strongly deformation retracts onto $`|C\setminus\{Q\}|`$ through a homotopy $`H`$ satisfying $`H(Q\times[0,1])\subseteq Q`$. Addition is the inverse move. Start the continuous-time chain $`C_t`$ at $`\{Q_0\}`$, with each allowed addition having rate $`\beta`$ and each allowed removal rate $`1`$.

Let $`a_n`$ count square-lattice self-avoiding polygons of enclosed area $`n`$, up to translation, and let $`\kappa=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n^{1/n}`$ be their area growth constant. Fix $`0<\beta<1/\kappa`$. Let $`\zeta`$ be the first return time to $`\{Q_0\}`$ after the chain has left that state, and set

```math
\xi=\sup_{0\le t<\zeta}\#C_t.
```

Is the exact exponential excursion-height asymptotic

```math
\lim_{T\to\infty,\ T\in\mathbb N}\mathbb P(\xi\ge T)^{1/T}=\kappa\beta
```

valid for every such $`\beta`$?

Equivalently, for $`\mu=\mathbb E\zeta\in(0,\infty)`$ and $`\eta_T=\mu/\mathbb P(\xi\ge T)`$, the target is $`\lim_{T\to\infty}\eta_T^{1/T}=1/(\kappa\beta)`$.

## Application

The rate would quantify how rarely a topology-preserving shape sampler reaches a large number of cells during an excursion from its smallest state. It would also specify the exponential scale in the source's rare-event time normalization.

## Status review

Theorem 6.5 proves planar ergodicity in this parameter range. Lemma 7.10 gives only the lower bound $`\liminf\eta_T^{1/T}\ge1/(\kappa\beta)`$, equivalently the corresponding upper bound on the excursion-tail exponential rate. Conjecture 7.11 asks for equality. The already proved Poisson limit for suitably normalized rare events does not supply this missing normalization asymptotic.

This is distinct from [501](499-higher-dimensional-ising-clumps.md), which concerns irreducibility and ergodicity in higher dimensions. Searches on 23 September 2026, including indexed arXiv, Zenodo, GitHub and Palomar checks, located no matching solution or announcement.
