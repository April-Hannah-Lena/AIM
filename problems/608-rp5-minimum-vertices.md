# 608. The minimum vertex number of a triangulation of real projective 5-space

**Area:** Computational topology and triangulated manifolds

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

A triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^5$ means a finite simplicial complex whose geometric realization is homeomorphic to real projective $5$-space. Let

$$
\mu_5=\min\{f_0(K): |K|\cong\mathbb{RP}^5\},
$$

where $f_0(K)$ is the number of vertices. Prove or disprove that

$$
\mu_5=24.
$$

The minimum is taken over all simplicial triangulations, without a symmetry or polytopal-realizability requirement.

## Application

Minimal triangulations provide small combinatorial models for topological computation and test the strength of lower bounds derived from cohomology. Resolving this case would extend the dimensions in which the exact minimum vertex number of real projective space is known.

## Status review

The source supplies a $24$-vertex example; the classical lower bound gives $22$. Its 20 September 2026 revision retains the minimality conjecture. The new asymptotic lower bound [2] concerns growth with dimension and does not give the required $24$-vertex lower bound in dimension five. The recent $44$-vertex construction for $\mathbb{RP}^6$ answers a different question and is not being admitted as open. Current searches found no matching resolution or duplicate.
