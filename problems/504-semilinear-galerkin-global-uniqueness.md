## Problem statement

Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$, $d=2$ or $3$, be a bounded convex polygon or polyhedron. Fix real Lipschitz coefficients $a_{ij}$ on $\overline\Omega$ with
$$\sum_{i,j=1}^d a_{ij}(x)\xi_i\xi_j\ge\Lambda|\xi|^2\qquad(\Lambda>0).$$
Let $b\in L^p(\Omega;\mathbb R^d)$, where $p>2$ if $d=2$ and $p\ge3$ if $d=3$, with $\operatorname{div}b\in L^2(\Omega)$. Fix $u\in L^2(\Omega)$. Suppose $f(x,t)$ is measurable in $x$, continuous and nondecreasing in $t$, $f(\cdot,0)\in L^2(\Omega)$, and for every $M>0$ there is $\phi_M\in L^2(\Omega)$ such that
$$|f(x,s)-f(x,t)|\le\phi_M(x)|s-t|\qquad(|s|,|t|\le M)$$
almost everywhere. No global growth bound on $f$ is imposed.

Take any conforming, shape-regular, quasi-uniform simplicial mesh family with maximum element diameter $h\to0$. Let $V_h\subset H_0^1(\Omega)$ be the continuous piecewise affine functions. Define
$$a(v,w)=\int_\Omega\left(\sum_{i,j}a_{ij}\partial_i v\,\partial_j w+(b\cdot\nabla v)w\right)dx.$$
Does there exist $h_0>0$, depending on the fixed data and mesh family, such that for every $h<h_0$ there is exactly one $y_h\in V_h$ satisfying
$$a(y_h,v_h)+\int_\Omega f(x,y_h)v_h\,dx=\int_\Omega u v_h\,dx\qquad(v_h\in V_h)?$$
Integrals are exact. Uniqueness is required among all discrete solutions, without an imposed uniform $L^\infty$ bound. A counterexample must retain fixed coefficients, reaction and forcing along arbitrarily fine meshes.

## Application

These equations discretize convection–diffusion–reaction states in PDE-constrained optimization. Global uniqueness would remove ambiguity in the discrete state assigned to a control; nonuniqueness would identify spurious branches that numerical optimization must exclude.

## Status review

**Known cases:** Theorem 3.5 of [1] proves eventual global uniqueness when one $\phi\in L^2$ bounds both $|f(x,t)|$ and its global Lipschitz coefficient. Under the full assumptions, Theorem 3.7 proves existence and uniqueness within every sufficiently large fixed $L^\infty$ ball for sufficiently small $h$.

**Remaining target:** Exclude additional solutions outside those balls, or construct a fixed-data counterexample. Convergence of the bounded branch alone is insufficient.

The 23 September 2026 search found no matching full resolution or announcement. Later linear Neumann and coercive bilinear-control results have different hypotheses. Registry coverage is not exhaustive.
