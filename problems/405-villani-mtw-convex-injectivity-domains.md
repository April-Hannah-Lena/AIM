# 405. Villani’s convex-injectivity-domain conjecture

**Area:** Optimal transport / Riemannian geometry

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

Let $(M,g)$ be a smooth compact connected Riemannian manifold without boundary. Write
$$I_x=\{v\in T_xM:\exists t>1\text{ with }d(x,\exp_x(tv))=t|v|_g\}.$$
For $v\in I_x$ and $\xi,\eta\in T_xM$, define
$$S_{x,v}(\xi,\eta)=-\frac32\left.\partial_s^2\partial_t^2\frac{d^2(\exp_x(t\xi),\exp_x(v+s\eta))}{2}\right|_{s=t=0}.$$
Assume $S_{x,v}(\xi,\eta)\ge0$ whenever $\langle\xi,\eta\rangle_g=0$; this is the weak Ma–Trudinger–Wang condition. Must $I_x$ be convex for every $x\in M$? No hypothesis excluding focal points on the cut locus is imposed.

## Application

Injectivity-domain convexity is a geometric prerequisite for continuous transport maps. It links the nonlinear PDE used to redistribute mass on curved surfaces and manifolds to the underlying geometry.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The SIAM theorem proves the conclusion under the additional nonfocal assumption; the 2022 survey retains the general statement as a conjecture. Searches through 22 September 2026 included Villani MTW convexity, injectivity domains, focal cut loci, and the authors’ later work. Special manifolds and stability results for already regular transport do not resolve the unrestricted implication.
