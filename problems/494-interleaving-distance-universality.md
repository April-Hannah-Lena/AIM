## Problem statement

Let $`k`$ be a field, $`n\ge1`$ and $`i\ge0`$. An $`n`$-parameter persistence module is a functor $`M:(\mathbb R^n,\le)\to\mathrm{Vect}_k`$, where the order is coordinatewise. Write $`\mathbf1=(1,\ldots,1)`$, $`M(\varepsilon)_a=M_{a+\varepsilon\mathbf1}`$, and let $`\eta_M^{2\varepsilon}:M\to M(2\varepsilon)`$ be its structure morphism. Modules $`M,N`$ are $`\varepsilon`$-interleaved if there are natural transformations

```math
\varphi:M\to N(\varepsilon),\qquad \psi:N\to M(\varepsilon)
```

satisfying

```math
\psi(\varepsilon)\circ\varphi=\eta_M^{2\varepsilon},\qquad
\varphi(\varepsilon)\circ\psi=\eta_N^{2\varepsilon}.
```

Define $`d_I(M,N)`$ as the infimum of such $`\varepsilon\ge0`$, with value $`+\infty`$ if none exists.

For a topological space $`X`$ and a function $`f:X\to\mathbb R^n`$, let

```math
P_i(f)_a=H_i(\{x\in X:f(x)\le a\};k),
```

using ordinary singular homology and the maps induced by sublevel-set inclusions. Functions need not be continuous. Let $`\mathcal R_{n,i}(k)`$ consist of modules isomorphic to some $`P_i(f)`$.

Call an extended pseudometric $`d`$ on isomorphism classes of $`n`$-parameter modules **$`i`$-stable** if, for every $`X`$ and every pair $`f,g:X\to\mathbb R^n`$,

```math
d(P_i(f),P_i(g))\le\sup_{x\in X}\|f(x)-g(x)\|_\infty.
```

An extended pseudometric is symmetric, vanishes on the diagonal and satisfies the triangle inequality, but may take value $`+\infty`$ or vanish on distinct classes. The supremum for empty $`X`$ is zero.

**Conjecture.** For every field $`k`$, every $`n\ge1`$ and every $`i\ge0`$, each $`i`$-stable extended pseudometric satisfies

```math
d(M,N)\le d_I(M,N)\qquad\text{for all }M,N\in\mathcal R_{n,i}(k).
```

The interleaving distance itself is $`i`$-stable. Thus the assertion is its maximality among stable distances on realizable modules. The realizability restriction is part of the conjecture; no finite-dimensionality assumption is imposed. This is Lesnick's Conjecture 5.7 with its definition of $`i`$-universality made explicit.

## Application

Multiparameter persistent homology describes data while varying several thresholds, such as geometric scale and density. The conjecture asks whether the interleaving distance retains the greatest discrimination compatible with uniform perturbation stability, regardless of the coefficient field. It concerns the mathematical justification for comparing these descriptors; it would not supply an efficient distance-computation algorithm.

## Status review

**Known cases:** Lesnick's Theorem 5.5 proves the displayed assertion for every $`n\ge1`$ when $`k=\mathbb Q`$ or $`k=\mathbb F_p`$ for a prime $`p`$, and $`i\ge1`$.

**Remaining target:** Establish the full assertion for arbitrary fields and all homology degrees, or give an $`i`$-stable distance and a realizable pair violating it. The known prime-field, positive-degree theorem leaves the full quantifiers unresolved. Lesnick's §5.4 also treats a related one-parameter, pointwise finite-dimensional problem using reduced homology; its conventions should not be silently substituted into this statement.

The 2023 survey still identifies the arbitrary-field extension as open. Searches on 2026-09-23 covered the conjecture, authors, field restrictions, proofs and counterexamples, including indexed arXiv, Zenodo, GitHub and Palomar results. No matching full-scope resolution or announcement was located. The homotopy-universality theorem, its September 2026 equivariant analogue, and September 2026 equalities for cohomology interleaving distances concern different objects or axioms. The searches are evidence, not a certificate that no announcement exists; Palomar access did not expose a complete registry listing.

 This entry counts the complete conjecture once, without splitting fields or homology degrees into separate problems.
