# 387. Uniqueness of positive reaction–diffusion equilibria outside two obstacles

**Area:** Reaction–diffusion; populations in perforated habitats

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22

## Problem statement

For any $`d\ge2`$, radii $`r_a,r_b>0`$ and centers $`a,b\in\mathbb R^d`$ with $`|a-b|>r_a+r_b`$, put

```math
\Omega=\mathbb R^d\setminus\bigl(\overline{B_{r_a}(a)}\cup\overline{B_{r_b}(b)}\bigr).
```

Let $`f\in C^{1,\gamma}([0,\infty))`$, $`0<\gamma<1`$, satisfy $`f(0)=f(1)=0`$, $`f'(0)>0`$, $`f'(1)<0`$, $`f>0`$ on $`(0,1)`$ and $`f<0`$ on $`(1,\infty)`$. Must

```math
-\Delta u=f(u)\quad\hbox{in }\Omega,\qquad u=0\quad\hbox{on }\partial\Omega
```

have exactly one bounded positive solution $`u\in C^2(\Omega)\cap C(\overline\Omega)`$? The per-capita growth rate $`f(s)/s`$ is allowed to increase, so the problem includes positive reactions outside the strong-KPP class. The obstacle separation is arbitrary subject to disjointness.

## Application

Two absorbing obstacles form a simple habitat in which their diffusion boundary layers can interact. The question asks whether this interaction alone can produce multiple positive equilibrium populations for a monostable growth law.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Checked on 22 September 2026 using the two-obstacle semilinear elliptic problem and later reaction–diffusion uniqueness results. The March 2026 primary paper asks this exact question. It proves uniqueness outside a single ball and explains why sufficiently separated balls are also covered. Its argument does not cover nearby disjoint obstacles. The general strong-KPP question imposes a decreasing growth quotient; the present problem instead fixes a simple geometry and permits a broader reaction class. No later result resolving arbitrary separation or giving a counterexample was located.
