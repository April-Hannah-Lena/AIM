# 658. Topological complexity in the homogeneous medial regime for all sample sizes

**Area:** Applied topology / random complexes
**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL
**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

Fix $p\in(0,1)$. For every nonempty subset $\sigma\subseteq[n]$, independently choose a Bernoulli variable $\xi_\sigma$ with success probability $p$. Define the random simplicial complex

$$
X_n=\{\sigma\subseteq[n]:\sigma\ne\varnothing,\ \xi_\tau=1
\text{ for every nonempty }\tau\subseteq\sigma\}.
$$

This is the homogeneous medial regime of the lower multiparameter model; vertices, as well as higher-dimensional faces, are sampled.

For a path-connected space $Y$, use the reduced topological complexity $\mathop{\mathrm{TC}}\nolimits(Y)$: the smallest $k\ge0$ such that $Y\times Y$ has an open cover by $k+1$ sets, each admitting a continuous local section of the endpoint map

$$
Y^{[0,1]}\longrightarrow Y\times Y,\qquad
\gamma\longmapsto(\gamma(0),\gamma(1)).
$$

Is it true, for every fixed $p\in(0,1)$, that

$$
\Pr\{\,|X_n|\text{ is path-connected and }\mathop{\mathrm{TC}}\nolimits(|X_n|)=2\,\}
\longrightarrow1\qquad(n\longrightarrow\infty),
$$

with the limit taken over all positive integers $n$?

## Application

Topological complexity counts the continuous local rules needed for motion planning. The statement would show that a typical large complex in this model requires exactly three such rules, uniformly along the full sequence of ambient sample sizes.

## Status review

**Known cases:** The 2026 preprint proves the upper bound $\mathop{\mathrm{TC}}\nolimits(|X_n|)\le2$ with probability tending to one along all $n$. It proves equality with probability tending to one when $n$ is restricted to a suitable subset of the positive integers having natural density one.

**Remaining target:** Remove that restriction on $n$ in the homogeneous model with fixed $p$.

The authors explicitly retain this question after proving their density-one result. The difficult sample sizes occur near transitions where two consecutive face counts have comparable magnitude. Current searches found no subsequent solution or announcement.
