# 164. An extreme solitary wave for the bidirectional Whitham system

**Area:** Nonlinear water-wave models

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-08

## Problem statement

Let $K$ be the convolution kernel on $\mathbb R$ whose Fourier transform is $\widehat K(\xi)=\tanh\xi/\xi$, extended continuously at zero. Does there exist $c>1$ and an even continuous profile $v:\mathbb R\to(0,\infty)$, smooth away from zero, strictly decreasing for $x>0$, and tending to zero at infinity, such that

$$
K*v=c^2v-\frac{3c}{2}v^2+\frac12v^3,\qquad v(0)=c\left(1-\frac1{\sqrt3}\right)?
$$

The associated surface profile is $\eta=cv-v^2/2$, with $\eta(0)=c^2/3$. These profiles yield a traveling solution $(\eta(x-ct),v(x-ct))$ of

$$
\partial_t\eta+\partial_x(K*v+\eta v)=0,\qquad\partial_tv+\partial_x(\eta+v^2/2)=0.
$$

## Application

The question asks whether this bidirectional model has a solitary wave at its limiting crest height, a basic test of its treatment of extreme water waves.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Searches for “Whitham Boussinesq extreme solitary existence 2026” and “bidirectional Whitham highest solitary waves” located small-amplitude existence and periodic extreme waves, but no extreme solitary-wave construction for this specific system. Existence of highest solitary waves for the unidirectional Whitham equation is already known and is not the question recorded here.
