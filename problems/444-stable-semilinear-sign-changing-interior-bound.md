# 444. Interior bounds for stable elliptic states with sign-changing reaction laws

**Area:** Semilinear elliptic PDEs and reaction equilibria

**Status:** 🔵 OPEN

**Last checked:** 2026-09-22
## Problem statement

For each $`d\in\{6,7,8,9\}`$, does there exist $`C_d<\infty`$ such that, for every $`f\in C^1(\mathbb R)`$ and every $`u\in C^2(B_1)`$ satisfying

```math
-\Delta u=f(u),\qquad \int_{B_1} f'(u)\varphi^2\le\int_{B_1}|\nabla\varphi|^2\quad(\varphi\in C_c^\infty(B_1)),
```

one has

```math
\|u\|_{L^\infty(B_{1/2})}\le C_d\|u\|_{W^{1,2}(B_1)}?
```

Here $`B_r\subset\mathbb R^d`$ is a centered ball, stability means the displayed nonnegative second-variation inequality, and no sign assumption is imposed on $`f`$ or $`u`$. The constant must be independent of the reaction law.

## Application

Stable stationary reaction-diffusion patterns can have both production and depletion regimes. A uniform estimate would rule out concentration in dimensions below ten without requiring the reaction to have one sign.

## Status review

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The survey identifies the missing interior boundedness estimate in dimensions 6–9 when f may change sign. The Peng–Zhang–Zhou theorem handles dimensions at most five with a W1,2 norm. Review-date searches for sign-changing stable solutions and later higher-dimensional interior estimates found no proof of the displayed universal bound. Entire-space Liouville theorems under special assumptions on the zeros of f have different hypotheses.
