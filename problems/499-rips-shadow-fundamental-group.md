# 499. Injectivity of the Rips shadow map on fundamental groups

**Area:** Applied topology and geometric reconstruction

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

**Last checked:** 2026-09-23

## Problem statement

Let $`X\subset\mathbb R^n`$ be a nonempty finite set, $`n\ge1`$, and $`r>0`$. Using Euclidean distances, form

```math
K=\mathop{\mathrm{VR}}\nolimits_{<}(X;r)=\{\sigma\subseteq X:\mathop{\mathrm{diam}}\nolimits(\sigma)<r\}.
```

Its shadow is the geometric union

```math
S(X;r)=\bigcup_{\sigma\in K}\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}\nolimits(\sigma)\subset\mathbb R^n.
```

The vertex inclusion extends affinely on each simplex to a continuous map $`p:|K|\to S(X;r)`$. For every base vertex $`x_0\in X`$, is

```math
p_*:\pi_1(|K|,x_0)\longrightarrow\pi_1(S(X;r),x_0)
```

injective? Thus, can a nontrivial loop in the abstract Rips complex become null-homotopic after projection onto its shadow?

This is Conjecture 7.2 of [1]. It concerns each finite sample at each fixed scale; no dense-sampling or vanishing-scale limit is assumed.

## Application

A Rips complex is built from pairwise distance information, while its shadow lies in the physical space containing the sample. Injectivity would ensure that projecting to this geometric representation does not erase a nontrivial fundamental-group class. This matters when relating combinatorial topology to geometric reconstructions of sampled spaces.

## Status review

**Known cases:** In the plane the shadow map induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups [2], also covering subsets of a line. In three-dimensional ambient space, [1] proves surjectivity; injectivity is the missing assertion.

**Remaining target:** Injectivity in all ambient dimensions at least three. The known failure of surjectivity in dimension four does not answer this question.

The 2026 limit theorem [3] concerns an inverse limit over scales after a direct limit over finite samples, under additional geometric hypotheses. It does not establish this fixed-sample assertion. No matching general resolution or announcement was found in the 23 September 2026 review.
