# 663. Vanishing threshold for first path homology of a random digraph

**Area:** Applied topology / random graphs
**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL
**Last checked:** 2026-09-24

## Problem statement

Let $G_n$ be a random digraph on $[n]$, with each ordered edge $(i,j)$, $i\ne j$, present independently with probability $p_n=n^\alpha$; reciprocal edges are allowed.

Use non-regular path homology over $\mathbb Q$. More explicitly, let $\Lambda_k$ be the vector space on all vertex sequences $[v_0,\ldots,v_k]$, allowing repetitions, with the alternating deletion boundary $\partial$. Let $A_k\subseteq\Lambda_k$ be spanned by the sequences whose successive ordered edges belong to $G_n$, and, for $k\ge1$, set

$$
\Omega_k=A_k\cap\partial^{-1}(A_{k-1}),\qquad
\beta_1^{\mathrm{nr}}(G_n)=\dim_{\mathbb Q}
\frac{\ker(\partial:\Omega_1\to\Omega_0)}{\partial\Omega_2}.
$$

No terms with repeated consecutive vertices are discarded when applying $\partial$; this specifies the non-regular convention. Here $\Omega_0=A_0$. This rational dimension is the rank of the integer path-homology group used in the source.

Is it true that, for every fixed $-2/3<\alpha\le0$,

$$
\Pr\{\beta_1^{\mathrm{nr}}(G_n)=0\}\longrightarrow1?
$$

## Application

The threshold would identify when first path homology ceases to detect statistically unusual structure in directed-network data under an independent-edge null model.

## Status review

**Known cases:** Vanishing is proved for $\alpha>-1/3$, whereas nonzero first Betti number occurs with high probability for $-1<\alpha<-2/3$. The source also proves vanishing when $p_n\gg(\log n/n)^{1/3}$.

**Remaining target:** Establish vanishing throughout $-2/3<\alpha\le-1/3$, or disprove the proposed exponent. The critical value $\alpha=-2/3$ is not included.

The regular first path Betti number is at most the non-regular one, so this assertion also implies the regular version posed in the same conjecture. These are kept as one problem. Current searches found no matching solution or announced proof.
