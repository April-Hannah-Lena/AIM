## Problem statement

For an integer $`d\ge3`$, set $`C=[0,\infty)^d`$ and consider the population map $`F_i(x)=x_i f_i(x)`$. Suppose $`f`$ is $`C^1`$ on an open neighborhood of $`C`$, $`f_i(x)>0`$ and $`\partial f_i/\partial x_j(x)<0`$ on $`C`$ for all $`i,j`$. Each positive coordinate axis has a fixed point $`q_i e_i`$, with $`q_i>0`$. For $`q=(q_1,\ldots,q_d)`$ assume

```math
\rho(M(x))<1\quad(x\in[0,q]),\qquad
M_{ij}(x)=-\frac{x_i}{f_i(x)}\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(x),
```

where $`\rho`$ denotes spectral radius and $`[0,q]=\prod_i[0,q_i]`$. These hypotheses guarantee a carrying simplex $`\Sigma\subset C\setminus\{0\}`$: a compact invariant unordered hypersurface to whose trajectories every nonzero trajectory is asymptotic. Here unordered means that no two distinct points are comparable coordinatewise.

Is $`\Sigma\cap(0,\infty)^d`$ necessarily a $`C^1`$ embedded $`(d-1)`$-dimensional submanifold for every such map? Equivalently, write $`\Sigma=\{R(u)u:u\in\Delta\}`$, where $`\Delta=\{u\in C:\sum_i u_i=1\}`$ and $`R:\Delta\to(0,\infty)`$ is its continuous radial representation: must $`R`$ be $`C^1`$ on the relative interior of $`\Delta`$? Only interior regularity is requested; no smoothness or transverse embedding at extinction faces is assumed.

## Applied significance

Competition maps describe populations whose per-capita growth decreases with every population density. Their carrying simplex contains the long-term nonzero dynamics. Interior $`C^1`$ regularity would justify smooth geometric reduction when analyzing coexistence, invariant manifolds and changes of stability.

## Status review

Baigent and the independently authored Mierczyński–Niu–Ruiz-Herrera paper identify the interior regularity gap. Convexity gives smoothness under additional hypotheses; local conjugacy or smoothness near particular fixed points does not settle the entire interior. Later retrotone and time-periodic existence results supply Lipschitz geometry and topological reduction. Known boundary singularities are outside the question.

Current resolution searches and comparisons are recorded in the [candidate ledger](../candidates/carrying-simplex-interior.json). A separate adversarial self-pass also compared older strongly monotone hypersurface theorems: their global positivity and basin assumptions do not establish this conclusion for all interior points. The original Tereščák preprint was not obtained; its scope was checked through Mierczyński’s full primary discussion, not represented as a direct reading. Integrated as [entry 301](../../../problems/301-carrying-simplex-interior.md) after the September 17, 2026 batch refresh.
